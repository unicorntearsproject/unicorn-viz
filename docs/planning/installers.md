# Unicorn Viz — Cross-Platform Installer Plan

**Owner:** Solo maintainer (one-person studio)
**Status:** Active — driving toward five gold-star installers
**Last updated:** 2026-09-09
**Canonical release repo:** https://github.com/djunicorntears/unicorn-viz
**Dev repo (not user-facing):** https://github.com/iDoMeteor/unicorn-viz

**Documentation pipeline planning:** `docs/planning/documentation-cicd-pipeline-plan.md`

> **Read this first:** §0.5 defines what "gold star" means and scores every
> channel against today's code. §16 is the authoritative, solo-friendly,
> free-tooling phased roadmap that supersedes the original §14 milestone
> sketch. §17 is the money ledger (what is free vs. what costs).
> **§18 is the same-day execution plan** — dependency-ordered blocks, the owner
> action batch, and an honest end-of-day scoreboard. §0.1 is the distribution
> model refresh (R2 + `manifest.json`, tags kept, GitHub Releases retired).

## 0. Decisions Locked In (2026-05-22)

- **Domain:** `unicornviz.io` will be hooked up; `get.unicornviz.io` →
  raw `install.sh` on the canonical repo. A second domain is planned (TBD).
- **GitHub CLI automation** for the canonical org is **blocked** on being
  logged in as the wrong user locally; defer any `gh` operations against
  `djunicorntears/*` until the right account is active.
- **Code-signing publisher name:** `Unicorn Viz`.
- **Snap Store + Flathub handles:** both names need to be **claimed**; not
  yet reserved. Treat as an owner action item before M5/M6.
- **Embedded Python:** bundle `python-build-standalone` on **every** Linux
  package and the Windows + macOS installers — uniform runtime, no system
  Python dependency anywhere.
- **Release tarball:** **core only.** Official drop-in submodules are
  packaged separately per channel (see §6) and are installed alongside core.
- **Per-drop-in dependency manager:** required — see §6. Drop-ins that add
  Python or system deps beyond the core set must ship a manifest and be
  resolvable by a single `unicorn-viz dropins install` command.
- **macOS signing/notarization:** deferred to post-launch ("after we ship
  and make some money"). v1 ships an **unsigned** `.dmg` with Gatekeeper
  workaround instructions in the README.
- **macOS minimum version:** open — recommendation stands at macOS 12
  (Monterey).
- **Homebrew tap repo name:** `djunicorntears/homebrew-unicornviz`
  (Homebrew convention: the GitHub repo must be named `homebrew-<tap>`, and
  users type `brew tap djunicorntears/unicornviz`). See §11.
- **Mobile (Android/iOS):** **not** in v1 scope.

### 0.1 Distribution Model Refresh (2026-06-30 — proposed; confirm as O1 in §18)

- **Decouple the build host from the distribution host.** They are independent
  choices; never tie one to the other.
- **Distribute via self-hosted object storage + `manifest.json`, not GitHub
  Releases.** Recommended host: **Cloudflare R2** (S3-compatible API, **zero
  egress fees**). Plain S3 is *not* recommended: every artifact is ~200 MB
  (bundled runtime) and S3 egress (~$0.09/GB) scales with popularity — exactly
  when a bill is least welcome. Fallback that is also free: GitHub Releases as
  the byte store behind a `get.unicornviz.io` redirect.
- **`manifest.json` is the single source of truth** for "latest version + where
  its artifacts live." `install.sh` reads it from a stable URL instead of the
  GitHub REST API. This deletes the GitHub-API dependency **and removes the need
  for a published GitHub Release to validate the release path** — a local or
  staging bucket is enough (§18 Block A).
- **Keep `git tag vX.Y.Z` for provenance** even though GitHub *Releases* are no
  longer the channel. Stamp tag + commit SHA into every artifact. The canonical
  repo **may now stay private** (public was only required for free CI minutes).
- **Build host: local for Linux** (fpm + all three packaging foundations work on
  the owner's Fedora box). **GitHub's free `macos-14` / `windows-2022` runners
  remain the only zero-cost way to build those two platforms** absent owner
  hardware. **Keep the nightly smoke CI as the QA safety net** regardless of
  where distribution goes — local builds are not clean-room.

## 0.5 Gold-Star Bar & Honest Scorecard (2026-06-21)

"Five gold-star installers for all platforms" needs a definition we can grade
against, otherwise it is a vibe. Here is the rubric. Each channel earns stars
**cumulatively** — you cannot claim ★4 until ★1–★3 hold.

### 0.5.1 The rubric (applies to every channel)

| Stars | Bar | What it proves |
|-------|-----|----------------|
| ★ | **Exists & builds.** A repeatable command/CI job produces the artifact. | We can ship *something*. |
| ★★ | **Works clean-room.** Installs on a fresh machine with **no dev tools**, app launches, and a menu / Start-menu / Dock entry with our unicorn icon appears. | A real first-time user succeeds. |
| ★★★ | **Self-contained & tidy.** Bundles its own Python runtime (`python-build-standalone`), pollutes no system interpreter, ships a **curated payload** (no `.git`/`.venv`/`logs`/`recordings`/dev scratch), preserves the user's `config.toml` on upgrade, and uninstalls cleanly. | It behaves like a real product, not a clone. |
| ★★★★ | **Automated & verified.** Built on tag in CI, checksums published, and a **nightly clean-container/VM install smoke** asserts `unicorn-viz --help` works. No human in the build loop. | Releases are boring and trustworthy. |
| ★★★★★ | **Trusted & discoverable.** Signed/notarized **or** shipped with a documented, low-friction trust path where signing costs money; published to the platform's native channel (vanity URL / Flathub / Snap Store / Homebrew); README badge + install docs live. | Strangers install it without fear or instructions. |

**Solo-dev escape hatch for ★5:** code-signing certs and notarization cost real
money (see §17). A channel may bank ★5 with an **unsigned artifact** *provided*
the trust path is one documented, copy-pasteable step (e.g. macOS right-click-open
+ `xattr` one-liner) and the signing step is already wired in CI behind a secret
gate (per §10) so flipping it on is a one-day job the day a cert lands. This keeps
"no paying for anything" from blocking the gold star.

### 0.5.2 Where each channel stands today

Graded against the actual code in this repo on 2026-06-21, not against intent.

| Channel | Today | Gap to next star |
|---|---|---|
| **Linux one-liner** (`install.sh` + `tools/install/lib.sh`) | ★★★★★ | **Done 2026-09-05:** bundled runtime, canonical `.desktop`, `--self-test`, nightly clean-container smoke, manifest-driven releases, **signed releases verified on install** (tamper-rejecting), hand-off bundles (`--from`). Vanity `get.unicornviz.io` is cosmetic and waits on hosting (O1/O2). |
| **Native `.deb` / `.rpm`** (`tools/packaging/build_native.sh`) | ★★★★ (+signed) | **Done 2026-09-05:** clean-container installs pass `--self-test`; rpm signed (`rpmsign`, verified `digests signatures OK`), debs covered by signed `SHA256SUMS`; `config.dist.toml` installed as a package config file. **★5 gate:** the app writes `logs/` and `runtime/` under `APP_ROOT`, read-only at `/opt` for a normal user — needs an XDG state/log location (config-cleanup team). |
| **Windows** (`tools/packaging/build_windows_portable.sh`, `packaging/windows/UnicornViz.iss`) | ★★★★ | **Verified 2026-09-09 on the `windows-2022` runner (run 34394811506):** the cross-built portable zip runs `--self-test` on Windows; `UnicornViz-Setup-<v>.exe` (125 MB core-only) compiles from the staged tree, installs silently, and `--self-test` passes through the installed launcher (`APP_ROOT: C:\uv-installed`, all deps import) — every step now asserts `self-test: OK`. Beta packs (`for-DJs`, general) ship the drop-ins with bundled media and a VLC pre-flight; CI ships them once O7 exists. **★5:** `signtool` gated on a cert secret (§17). |
| **macOS `.dmg`** (nothing yet) | ☆ | Stand up `briefcase` universal2 bundle with `python-build-standalone`, `.icns`, Info.plist usage strings; **★2–3:** Dock/Spotlight + curated payload; **★4:** `macos-14` CI build + smoke; **★5:** Homebrew cask + README Gatekeeper workaround (notarization deferred behind Apple cert — §17). |
| **Flatpak** (`packaging/flatpak/`) | ★★★★ | **Done 2026-09-04:** manifest for runtime 25.08 consuming the release tarball; PortAudio module; wheels-first offline pip module via `tools/packaging/flatpak_wheels.py` (python-rtmidi built from sdist); tightened `finish-args`; metainfo + desktop + icon ladder; launcher exporting `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT` and `PYSDL2_DLL_PATH`. **Local build + in-sandbox `--self-test` pass.** **★5:** Flathub PR (O5, screenshots, `--device=all` narrowed). |
| **Snap** (`packaging/snap/snapcraft.yaml`) | ★ (on paper) | **Done 2026-09-04:** manifest upgraded to core24 / strict / explicit plugs, `dump`-staged app + assets siblings, launcher with `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT`, desktop + icon. **Next:** build + test with snapcraft/LXD (not on this box); Snap Store name (O5). |

**Cross-cutting blockers that gate stars on multiple channels at once:**

1. **`python-build-standalone` bundling** is a locked decision (§0). The shared
   helper now exists (`tools/packaging/fetch_runtime.sh`, landed 2026-06-21) and
   is wired into both Linux bash installers. It is the single biggest lever: it
   unlocks ★3 for the one-liner (done), native packages (done 2026-06-30),
   Windows, and macOS. Windows and macOS still need to adopt it (Phases 3–4).
2. **Curated payload staging** — ✅ done. `tools/packaging/stage_payload.sh`
   (landed 2026-06-29) produces an allowlisted core payload (no `.git`/`.venv`/
   `logs`/`docs`/`drop-ins`/licensed sims packs) with a leak guard. Windows,
   macOS, and native packaging stage from it so none can ship the whole repo.
3. **Drop-in dependency system (§6)** — `dropin.toml` + `unicorn-viz dropins`
   CLI are unbuilt. Not required for core-installer gold stars, but required
   before the "official drop-in pack" UX and before drop-ins can be promised to
   install cleanly on any channel. Sequenced last (§16 Phase 7).

4. **Asset resolution is a launcher contract, not a packaging detail.**
   `APP_ROOT` is the package's parent directory. Any launcher that runs the
   package out of a bundled runtime's site-packages **must export
   `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT=<prefix that contains assets/>`** (landed 2026-06-30 for
   the one-liner and native packages). Windows (`.cmd`/`.ps1`, Inno `[Run]`) and
   macOS (launcher stub or `Info.plist` `LSEnvironment`) must do the same, or
   they will silently re-introduce the bug that a normal `pip install` exposed.
5. **`--help` is not a real smoke test.** It cannot detect the asset bug above.
   Every install smoke (nightly containers, package installs, release-path
   validation) must also assert asset resolution. Cheap enabler, planned in §18
   Block C: a headless `unicorn-viz --self-test` that prints `APP_ROOT`, verifies
   `assets/` + fonts, imports the heavy deps, and exits non-zero on failure.

## 1. Current Implementation Snapshot

This section is the working inventory for the installer effort. Keep it
current as the repo evolves so we always know which surfaces own install-time
behavior and which dependencies belong to the core versus an individual drop-in.

### 1.1 Installer and packaging entrypoints

- `install.sh` - public one-line Linux bootstrapper for release artifacts.
- `tools/install/lib.sh` - shared distro detection, dependency install, and
  desktop integration helpers.
- `tools/install_linux.sh` - clone-local Linux installer wrapper.
- `tools/install/uninstall_linux.sh` - uninstall helper for the Linux flow.
- `tools/packaging/build_native.sh` - native `.deb` / `.rpm` packager.
- `packaging/windows/UnicornViz.iss` - Windows installer definition.
- `packaging/flatpak/io.unicornviz.UnicornViz.yml` - Flatpak manifest.
- `packaging/snap/snapcraft.yaml` - Snap manifest.
- `.github/workflows/release-installers.yml` - release-time packaging fan-out.

### 1.2 Core dependency inventory

The authoritative Python runtime dependency list lives in
`requirements.txt`. The current core set is:

- `moderngl>=5.10`
- `pysdl2>=0.9.16`
- `pysdl2-dll>=2.28`
- `numpy>=1.26`
- `scipy>=1.12`
- `sounddevice>=0.4.6`
- `python-rtmidi>=1.5`
- `Pillow>=10.0`
- `psutil>=5.9`
- `opencv-python-headless>=4.9`

Current Linux installer and native package system dependencies are:

| Family | Packages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| APT / Debian | `python3`, `python3-venv`, `python3-dev`, `libsdl2-dev`, `libgl1-mesa-dev`, `libffi-dev`, `libpipewire-0.3-dev`, `libasound2-dev`, `ffmpeg`, `git`, `curl` | Used by the release installer and native package build path. |
| DNF / Fedora | `python3`, `python3-devel`, `gcc-c++`, `make`, `SDL2-devel`, `mesa-libGL-devel`, `libffi-devel`, `pipewire-devel`, `alsa-lib-devel`, `git`, `curl`, `ffmpeg` | Fedora install helper prefers the distro package manager and falls back gracefully if `ffmpeg` is not available. |
| Pacman / Arch | `python`, `python-pip`, `sdl2`, `mesa`, `libffi`, `pipewire`, `alsa-lib`, `ffmpeg`, `git`, `curl` | Current clone-local installer path. |

### 1.3 Known drop-in dependency inventory

Only a small subset of drop-ins currently declares extra install-time
requirements beyond the core set:

| Drop-in | Extra dependencies | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| `webcam-01` | `opencv-python-headless >= 4.9` | `drop-ins/webcam-01/README.md` |
| `spotify-01` | `playerctl` available on `PATH` | `drop-ins/spotify-01/README.md` |

All other drop-ins currently discovered in this repo appear to rely on the
core dependency set only. Re-check this table whenever a drop-in README,
manifest, or import surface changes.

### 1.4 Current packaging risk to watch

The current Fedora installer failure is caused by the project build backend
declaration, not by a missing system package. `pip install .` is invoking a
backend path that cannot be imported from the build environment, so the native
package flow never reaches the actual project build.

The fix is to use a valid setuptools backend and keep the build requirements in
sync with the packaging toolchain so isolated builds can resolve the project
metadata cleanly.

---

## 1. Goals

A first-time user must be able to install Unicorn Viz on any supported OS in
**one obvious step**, end up with:

1. A working `unicorn-viz` command on PATH (or platform-equivalent).
2. A menu / Start-menu entry that uses our unicorn avatar as the icon and
   launches the app on click.
3. A self-contained Python environment that does not pollute the system
   interpreter.
4. A clearly tagged version that matches a GitHub release on
   `djunicorntears/unicorn-viz`.

### Target deliverables per release tag

| Platform              | Deliverable                                   | Channel                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Linux (any distro)    | `curl … \| bash` one-liner                    | `install.unicornviz.io` redirect → raw GitHub script |
| Ubuntu/Debian (amd64) | `unicorn-viz_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb`                 | GitHub Releases asset    |
| Fedora/RHEL (x86_64)  | `unicorn-viz-X.Y.Z-1.fc40.x86_64.rpm`         | GitHub Releases asset    |
| Linux (sandboxed)     | Flathub: `io.unicornviz.UnicornViz`           | Flathub                  |
| Linux (sandboxed)     | Snap Store: `unicorn-viz`                     | Snap Store               |
| Windows 10/11 (x64)   | `UnicornViz-Setup-X.Y.Z.exe` (Inno Setup)     | GitHub Releases asset    |
| Windows (portable)    | `UnicornViz-Portable-X.Y.Z.zip`               | GitHub Releases asset    |
| macOS 12+ (universal2)| `UnicornViz-X.Y.Z.dmg` (notarized)            | GitHub Releases asset    |
| macOS (Homebrew)      | `brew install --cask unicorn-viz`             | Homebrew tap (`djunicorntears/tap`) |
| Android / iOS         | Not planned for v1 — see §12 feasibility note | —                        |

All artifacts are produced by GitHub Actions on tag push (`v*.*.*`) and
uploaded to the matching GitHub Release on the **canonical repo**.

---

## 2. Versioning & Release Source of Truth

> **Changed 2026-06-30 (see §0.1 and §18):** tag-push → GitHub Release is no
> longer the distribution path. Tags stay for provenance; artifacts plus a
> `manifest.json` are published to self-hosted object storage (R2 recommended).
> The contract below is kept as the *build* reference; its "upload to GitHub
> Release" steps are superseded.

- Single version string lives in `pyproject.toml` (`[project].version`).
- Tagging: annotated tags on `djunicorntears/unicorn-viz` named `vX.Y.Z`.
- CI extracts the version from the tag (`${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}`) and stamps it
  into every artifact (`.deb`, `.rpm`, `.iss`, `snapcraft.yaml`, flatpak
  manifest, installer script defaults).
- Pre-release tags (`vX.Y.Z-rc.N`) build artifacts but mark the GitHub Release
  as **pre-release** and skip Flathub/Snap stable channel pushes.

### Release-time automation contract

A single workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) is triggered on tag push and
fans out to matrix jobs:

```
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*.*.*']
```

Jobs (parallel where possible):

1. `build-linux-bash-installer` — lints `install.sh`, uploads it as a release
   asset and updates the `latest` symlink-style asset.
2. `build-deb` — builds `.deb` for `amd64` (and `arm64` later) on Ubuntu 22.04
   and 24.04 runners.
3. `build-rpm` — builds `.rpm` on Fedora container (`fedora:40`).
4. `build-flatpak` — builds & validates the flatpak bundle; on stable tags,
   opens a PR against the Flathub manifest repo.
5. `build-snap` — runs `snapcraft remote-build`; on stable tags, pushes to
   the `stable` channel via stored credentials.
6. `build-windows-installer` — builds Inno Setup `.exe` and portable `.zip`.
7. `publish-release` — gathers artifacts from all jobs, creates / updates the
   GitHub Release, attaches checksums (`SHA256SUMS`) and a `manifest.json`
   listing every artifact + version for the bash installer to consume.

---

## 3. One-Line Linux Bash Installer

### 3.1 User experience

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djunicorntears/unicorn-viz/main/install.sh | bash
```

(Optional vanity URL `https://get.unicornviz.io` redirecting to the above —
not required for v1.)

Flags supported via `bash -s --`:

| Flag                  | Effect                                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `--prefix <dir>`      | Override install root (default: `~/.local/share/unicorn-viz`) |
| `--version <vX.Y.Z>`  | Pin a specific release (default: latest stable tag)     |
| `--channel stable\|prerelease` | Pick latest stable or latest prerelease        |
| `--no-deps`           | Skip system package install (assume user did it)        |
| `--no-desktop`        | Skip `.desktop` entry / icon install                    |
| `--system`            | System-wide install to `/opt/unicorn-viz` (needs sudo)  |
| `--uninstall`         | Remove install, venv, desktop entry, icon               |
| `--dry-run`           | Print actions without executing                         |

### 3.2 Script responsibilities

1. **Refuse to run as root** unless `--system` is given (avoid surprise
   `pip install` into system Python).
2. **Detect distro** via `/etc/os-release` (`ID`, `ID_LIKE`). Supported:
   `ubuntu`, `debian`, `linuxmint`, `pop`, `fedora`, `rhel`, `centos`,
   `rocky`, `almalinux`, `arch`, `manjaro`, `endeavouros`. Fall back to a
   clear error listing the packages the user must install manually.
3. **Install system deps** with `apt-get` / `dnf` / `pacman` using the same
   package sets currently in `tools/install_linux.sh` (extracted into a
   shared shell function library `install/lib.sh` so the bash installer and
   the in-tree dev installer stay in sync).
4. **Resolve release tag** via the GitHub REST API:
   `GET /repos/djunicorntears/unicorn-viz/releases/latest`. Honor
   `--version` and `--channel`. Fall back gracefully if the API is rate-limited
   by reading a static `manifest.json` from the latest release.
5. **Download & verify** the release source tarball
   (`unicorn-viz-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`) and matching `SHA256SUMS` file.
   Verify checksum with `sha256sum -c`. If `gpg` and our signing key are
   present, also verify the detached `.asc` signature (optional in v1, planned
   for v1.1 — see §10).
6. **Create venv** at `<prefix>/venv` using Python 3.11+. If the system
   Python is older, surface a clear, distro-specific remediation message
   (e.g. `sudo dnf install python3.11`).
7. **Install Python deps** with `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`,
   then `pip install .` so the `unicorn-viz` console script is generated in
   `<prefix>/venv/bin/`.
8. **Install desktop integration** (see §7):
   - `~/.local/share/applications/unicorn-viz.desktop`
   - `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/unicorn-viz.png`
   - `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/unicorn-viz.svg` (if SVG is
     added later)
   - Symlink `~/.local/bin/unicorn-viz` → `<prefix>/venv/bin/unicorn-viz`
     (warn if `~/.local/bin` is not on `PATH`).
9. **Run `update-desktop-database`** and `gtk-update-icon-cache` if available
   (best-effort, never fatal).
10. **Print a final summary**: install path, version, how to launch, how to
    uninstall, location of `config.toml` template.

### 3.3 Hardening rules

- `set -Eeuo pipefail`, an `ERR` trap that prints the failing command and
  line, and a `cleanup` trap that removes the temp download dir.
- All `curl` calls use `-fsSL --retry 3 --retry-delay 2`.
- All `wget` references replaced with `curl` to avoid the wget/curl bifurcation.
- Idempotent re-runs: detect existing install, prompt to upgrade in place
  (preserve user's `config.toml`).
- No `eval`, no `curl … | sudo bash`. The script asks once for sudo and caches
  the timestamp via `sudo -v`.
- Lint with `shellcheck` in CI; fail the workflow on warnings.

### 3.4 Files added

```
install.sh                              # the public one-liner (top of repo)
tools/install/lib.sh                    # shared distro detection + deps
tools/install/uninstall_linux.sh        # invoked by install.sh --uninstall
```

`tools/install_linux.sh` becomes a thin wrapper around `tools/install/lib.sh`
for dev contributors working from a clone.

## 4. Native Packages (.deb / .rpm)

### 4.1 Package layout (FHS)

```
/opt/unicorn-viz/                       app files (venv lives here)
/opt/unicorn-viz/venv/                  bundled Python venv (relocatable)
/usr/bin/unicorn-viz                    -> /opt/unicorn-viz/venv/bin/unicorn-viz
/usr/share/applications/unicorn-viz.desktop
/usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/unicorn-viz.png
/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/unicorn-viz.svg
/usr/share/doc/unicorn-viz/             README, LICENSE, config.full.example.toml
/etc/unicorn-viz/config.toml            shipped as conffile (dpkg/rpm aware)
```

Bundling the venv into `/opt/unicorn-viz/venv` lets us avoid Python ABI
fragility and gives us one `.deb` / `.rpm` per (distro × arch) pair.

### 4.2 Build approach

Use **[fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm)** as the package generator.
It runs cleanly in CI, supports both `.deb` and `.rpm`, and lets us reuse a
single `tools/packaging/build_native.sh` script.

Build pipeline per target distro:

1. Spin up a container matching the target distro:
   - `ubuntu:22.04`, `ubuntu:24.04`, `debian:12` → `.deb`
   - `fedora:40`, `fedora:41` → `.rpm`
2. Install system build deps (same set as §3.2 step 3) **plus** `patchelf` and
   any libraries needed by `python-rtmidi` / `sounddevice` to build wheels.
3. Create a fresh venv at `/opt/unicorn-viz/venv` with the target distro's
   Python 3.11+.
4. `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt && pip install .`
5. Make the venv relocatable: rewrite the shebangs of every script in
   `venv/bin/*` to `#!/opt/unicorn-viz/venv/bin/python` (works because the
   final install path matches the build path).
6. Stage files into `staging/` matching §4.1.
7. Invoke `fpm` with:
   - shared metadata (name, version, license=MIT, vendor, URL, description),
   - per-format dependencies (`Depends:` for deb, `Requires:` for rpm),
   - postinst running `update-desktop-database` and `gtk-update-icon-cache`,
   - prerm cleanly removing the symlink if it points at our binary.
8. Upload artifact `unicorn-viz_${VERSION}_${ARCH}.${EXT}` to the release.

| Debian/Ubuntu | `libsdl2-2.0-0`, `libgl1`, `libffi8`, `libpipewire-0.3-0`, `libasound2`, `ffmpeg`, `python3.11` (Ubuntu 22.04 needs deadsnakes-equivalent — see note) |
| Fedora        | `SDL2`, `mesa-libGL`, `libffi`, `pipewire`, `alsa-lib`, `ffmpeg-free`, `python3.11` |

**Ubuntu 22.04 Python note:** if the target distro ships Python < 3.11, the
`.deb` for that distro ships its own Python 3.11 inside `/opt/unicorn-viz/`
via `python-build-standalone` (Indygreg). This removes the deadsnakes
requirement and yields identical runtimes across all Ubuntu LTS versions.

### 4.4 Repository hosting (post-v1)

- Optional v1.1: publish an APT repo and a DNF/YUM repo on GitHub Pages so
  users can `apt-add-repository` / drop a `.repo` file and receive updates.
- Until then, the bash installer's `--channel` logic handles update polling.

---

## 5. Flatpak & Snap

### 5.1 Flatpak (Flathub target)

Current state: minimal manifest in `packaging/flatpak/io.unicornviz.UnicornViz.yml`.
Gaps to close before Flathub submission:

1. **Pin runtime deps as flatpak sources** — Flathub forbids `pip install`
   reaching the network. Generate a `python3-requirements.json` from
   `requirements.txt` using
   [`flatpak-pip-generator`](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/tree/master/pip)
   and commit it next to the manifest. CI regenerates and diffs on every
   release.
2. **Wheels with native code** (`python-rtmidi`, `sounddevice`, `moderngl`)
   must build inside the sandbox — add their build deps to a `modules:`
   entry (`libffi`, `alsa-lib`, `portaudio`, `jack-dev` headers via the SDK).
3. **Permissions audit (`finish-args`):**
   - Replace `--filesystem=home` with `--filesystem=xdg-music:ro`,
     `--filesystem=xdg-videos:ro`, `--filesystem=xdg-pictures:ro`, plus
     `--filesystem=xdg-config/unicorn-viz:create`.
   - Add `--device=all` only if MIDI / webcam access requires it; otherwise
     keep `--device=dri` and add `--device=input` for MIDI.
   - Replace `--socket=pulseaudio` with `--socket=pipewire` once Flathub
     runtime supports it (24.08 does); keep pulseaudio as fallback.
   - Drop `--share=network` unless the in-app `tools/fetch_acid_ans.py`
     workflow is exposed to end users (it currently is not).
4. **Desktop file + AppStream metadata** required by Flathub:
   - `io.unicornviz.UnicornViz.desktop`
   - `io.unicornviz.UnicornViz.metainfo.xml` (with screenshots, release notes,
     OARS rating, content rating, license SPDX = `MIT`).
   - 256×256 and 512×512 PNG icons + scalable SVG.
   All three live under `packaging/flatpak/data/`.
5. **CI build job** uses `flatpak-builder --user --install-deps-from=flathub`
   inside `bilelmoussaoui/flatpak-github-actions/flatpak-builder@v6`, and on
   stable tags opens a PR against `flathub/io.unicornviz.UnicornViz` (which
   we will request after the first successful local end-to-end build).

### 5.2 Snap (Snap Store target)

Current state: minimal `snapcraft.yaml` with `devmode` confinement.
Roadmap:

1. Switch `base: core24` (matches Ubuntu 24.04, current LTS at the time of
   this plan).
2. Move from `devmode` to `strict` confinement and declare the precise plugs:
   `opengl`, `wayland`, `x11`, `audio-record`, `audio-playback`, `alsa`,
   `pulseaudio`, `removable-media`, `home`, `raw-usb` (for MIDI).
3. Promote `grade: devel` → `grade: stable` once strict confinement passes
   the snap review.
4. Add a `desktop-launch` wrapper so the snap integrates with the application
   menu and picks up the icon from `meta/gui/unicorn-viz.png` and
   `meta/gui/unicorn-viz.desktop`.
5. CI uses `snapcore/action-build@v1` to produce the `.snap`, attaches it to
   the GitHub Release, and on stable tags runs `snapcraft upload --release=stable`
   using a token stored in `SNAP_STORE_LOGIN`.
6. Manual one-time setup: register the `unicorn-viz` name on the Snap Store
   under the `djunicorntears` publisher.

### 5.3 Known sandbox risks to validate before promoting either

- PipeWire device latency and xrun behavior under `pipewire` socket vs.
  `pulseaudio` socket.
- `python-rtmidi` enumerating ALSA sequencer ports inside the sandbox.
- `moderngl` requiring `LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE=1` in some Mesa/Wayland combos.
- File pickers for user-supplied media (drop-ins like `videos-01`,
  `images-01`) — confirm they work under both XDG portals.

Each of these gets a dedicated checklist item in the release QA matrix.

---

## 6. Drop-In Dependency Management

Drop-ins live in their own private repos (per project policy) and may pull
in Python packages or system libraries that the core does **not** require.
The core release tarball, `.deb`, `.rpm`, Windows installer, and `.dmg`
ship the **core dependency set only**. Drop-ins must declare and resolve
their extra deps through a shared mechanism.

### 6.1 Drop-in dependency manifest

Every drop-in repo (and every directory under `drop-ins/`) gains a
`dropin.toml` at its root:

```toml
[dropin]
id = "webcam-01"
name = "Webcam"
version = "0.3.2"
min_core = "0.9.0"

[dependencies.python]
# PEP 508 requirement strings, resolved with pip inside the core venv.
requires = [
  "opencv-python>=4.9",
  "av>=12.0",
]

[dependencies.system]
# Per-platform native package names. Missing keys = nothing needed there.
apt    = ["libv4l-dev", "v4l-utils"]
dnf    = ["libv4l-devel", "v4l-utils"]
pacman = ["v4l-utils"]
brew   = ["ffmpeg"]
winget = []   # bundled in the Windows installer payload

[dependencies.binaries]
# Optional: extra runtime binaries to fetch (e.g., ffmpeg static builds).
ffmpeg = { source = "system", min_version = "6.0" }

[capabilities]
# Used by the dependency checker to warn about sandbox limits.
needs_camera = true
needs_midi   = false
needs_network = false
```

The manifest is the **single source of truth** for that drop-in's extra
requirements. The core installer never hard-codes drop-in deps.

Every drop-in also ships a platform-aware installer bundle. For complex
drop-ins, the installer may add Python or system dependencies before staging
files. For simple drop-ins, the installer is still required but may only copy
the bundle into the correct drop-in location for the current OS.

### 6.2 `unicorn-viz dropins` CLI

A new subcommand group on the core CLI handles enumeration, checking, and
installing drop-in deps. Implemented in `unicornviz/dropins/cli.py`.

| Command                                  | Behavior                                                       |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `unicorn-viz dropins list`               | List installed drop-ins + version + dep status (OK / missing). |
| `unicorn-viz dropins check`              | Read each `dropin.toml`, verify Python + system deps, report.  |
| `unicorn-viz dropins check <id>`         | Same, scoped to one drop-in.                                   |
| `unicorn-viz dropins install`            | Install missing deps for every enabled drop-in.                |
| `unicorn-viz dropins install <id>`       | Install for one drop-in.                                       |
| `unicorn-viz dropins doctor`             | Verbose diagnostics: platform detection, package manager, sandbox status, write-permission to the core venv. |

Behavior:

1. **Python deps** are installed into the **core venv** via
   `pip install --upgrade <pkg>`. This is the same venv the core uses so
   imports just work. For sandboxed installs (flatpak/snap) where the venv
   is read-only, the command prints a clear message that the drop-in is
   incompatible with the sandboxed build and recommends the `.deb`/`.rpm`
   /bash-installer/native installer instead.
2. **System deps** are installed via the platform package manager (`apt`,
   `dnf`, `pacman`, `brew`, `winget`). The command prompts for sudo when
   needed; in `--non-interactive` mode it prints the exact command instead
   of running it.
3. **No drop-in is auto-enabled** by `dropins install` — enabling/disabling
   is a separate concern handled by `config.toml`. `install` only ensures
   the deps are present for whatever the user later enables.
4. **Idempotent:** running twice does nothing the second time.
5. **Offline-aware:** if no network, prints the list of missing deps and
   exits non-zero so CI / packaging scripts can detect the gap.

6. **Installer required for every drop-in:** even when a drop-in has no extra
  runtime dependencies, it still ships an installer that stages its files to
  the proper drop-in directory for the host platform.

### 6.3 Boot-time gating

The core loader already wraps drop-in imports in `try/except` per the
Drop-In Independence Rules. We extend it:

- On startup, for every enabled drop-in, run a lightweight version of
  `dropins check` (no network, no installs) and:
  - Log a single-line WARN per drop-in with missing deps.
  - Surface the warning in the on-screen `H` help overlay's drop-in section
    so the user sees "webcam-01: missing opencv-python" without digging in
    logs.
  - Skip loading that drop-in's GL resources so it stays a true no-op
   rather than crashing mid-render.
- An optional `--strict-dropins` CLI flag causes startup to exit non-zero
  when any enabled drop-in has missing deps (useful for installer smoke
  tests in CI).

### 6.4 Core installer responsibilities

Each platform's installer is responsible for the **core dep set only**:

- Linux bash installer / `.deb` / `.rpm`: install `python3.11`, SDL2, GL,
  pipewire, alsa, ffmpeg, libffi, plus the bundled `python-build-standalone`
  runtime and the core's `requirements.txt`.
- Windows installer: bundle Python 3.11 embed, ffmpeg, SDL2 DLLs, and
  install `requirements.txt` into the embedded site-packages.
- macOS `.dmg`: bundle Python 3.11 universal2, ffmpeg, SDL2 frameworks,
  and install `requirements.txt` into the bundle's `runtime/`.
- Flatpak / snap: same as above but inside the sandbox.

After the core is installed, the user (or a post-install helper) runs
`unicorn-viz dropins install` to fetch the extras for the drop-ins they
want to use. The installer's final-summary screen prints this command
verbatim so the discovery path is obvious.

### 6.5 Optional: "meta" drop-in installers per platform

For the curated official drop-in set, we publish per-platform helper
packages that wrap `unicorn-viz dropins install` for users who prefer
GUI/menu installation:

- Linux: a `unicorn-viz-dropins-official` `.deb`/`.rpm` whose postinst calls
  `unicorn-viz dropins install --bundle official`.
- Windows: an optional checkbox on the main installer's last page —
  "Install official drop-in pack now" — which runs the same command.
- macOS: same checkbox on the `.dmg`'s first-run helper.

The "official drop-in bundle" is defined by a list in
`packaging/dropins/official-bundle.toml` in the canonical repo and is
versioned alongside the core release.

### 6.6 Per-drop-in repo policy update

The project policy already requires drop-ins to live in their own private
repos as submodules. We add:

- Every drop-in repo **must** ship `dropin.toml` at its root before it can
  be added as a submodule.
- CI in each drop-in repo runs `unicorn-viz dropins check` against a fresh
  core install to verify the manifest matches reality.
- A new `tools/lint_dropin.py` in the core repo validates manifests across
  all `drop-ins/*/dropin.toml` so PRs that break the contract fail fast.

### 6.7 Current drop-in installer matrix

Current policy: every shipped drop-in has an installer bundle. When no extra
deps are needed, the installer is copy-only and places the drop-in into the
appropriate `drop-ins/` target path for the OS/package format.

| Drop-in | Installer mode | Extra dependencies | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| alien-invasion-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Stages effect files into the drop-in location. |
| auto-vj-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Automation bundle remains self-contained. |
| candy-frame-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Simple effect bundle. |
| control-room-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Control surface bundle. |
| cyber-war-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Simple effect bundle. |
| disco-ball-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Simple effect bundle. |
| grand-finale-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Sequenced effect bundle. |
| hacker-terminal-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Simple effect bundle. |
| images-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Media bundle with bundled assets. |
| multi-head-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Display subsystem bundle. |
| postfx-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Post-processing bundle. |
| projectm-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Engine integration bundle. |
| sims-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Media/effect bundle. |
| spotify-01 | Copy-only + dependency check installer | `playerctl` on PATH for local mode | Installer verifies host MPRIS support before enabling local metadata mode; Web API auth prep is documented separately. |
| streaming-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Streaming subsystem bundle. |
| textures-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Media bundle. |
| tron-grid-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Simple effect bundle. |
| unicorn-tears-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Simple effect bundle. |
| videos-01 | Copy-only bundle installer | None listed | Media bundle. |
| webcam-01 | Bundle installer + dependency check | `opencv-python-headless >= 4.9` | Installer verifies camera stack before enabling. |

If a new drop-in appears in the workspace, it must be added to this matrix
before release packaging is considered complete.

Copy-only installer bundles now exist for the easy drop-ins, including the
simple effects and subsystem bundles that only need file staging. `webcam-01`
and `spotify-01` remain the dependency-aware follow-up installers that will be
upgraded next.

## 7. Desktop / Menu Integration (Linux)

Single canonical `.desktop` file shipped by **every** Linux delivery channel
(`.deb`, `.rpm`, flatpak, snap, bash installer):

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Unicorn Viz
GenericName=Audio-Reactive Visualizer
Comment=Fullscreen OpenGL demoscene visualizer with audio + MIDI control
Exec=unicorn-viz %U
Icon=unicorn-viz
Terminal=false
Categories=AudioVideo;Audio;Graphics;Player;
Keywords=visualizer;demoscene;vj;audio;midi;ansi;
StartupNotify=true
StartupWMClass=unicorn-viz
```

- Icon: `assets/icons/unicorn-viz.png` (already in repo). Generate additional
  sizes (48, 64, 128, 256, 512) at release time via `magick convert` and
  install into the matching `hicolor/<size>x<size>/apps/` directories.
- An SVG version (`unicorn-viz.svg`) is a v1.1 follow-up; the PNG ladder
  covers all current desktops in the interim.
- Bash installer writes to `~/.local/share/{applications,icons}`.
- `.deb` / `.rpm` write to `/usr/share/{applications,icons}` and run
  `update-desktop-database` / `gtk-update-icon-cache` in postinst.
- Flatpak / snap publish via their respective manifests (which the host
  exposes to the menu automatically).

---

## 8. Windows Installer

### 7.1 Goal

Drop the current "clone + run batch file" flow in favor of a real
**`.exe` installer** that:

- Installs into `%ProgramFiles%\UnicornViz\` (per-machine) or
  `%LocalAppData%\Programs\UnicornViz\` (per-user, selectable on the first
  page).
- Bundles its own Python 3.11 runtime — no reliance on a system Python or
  the `py` launcher.
- Bundles ffmpeg.
- Creates a Start menu entry **and** an optional desktop / taskbar entry,
  both with our unicorn avatar icon.
- Registers a proper uninstaller in Apps & Features.
- Is signed with an EV (or, initially, OV) code-signing certificate so
  SmartScreen doesn't bury it (see §10).

### 7.2 Toolchain

Continue with **Inno Setup 6** (existing `packaging/windows/UnicornViz.iss`)
but rework it substantially:

1. CI job runs on `windows-2022` GitHub-hosted runner.
2. Build steps before invoking `ISCC.exe`:
   - Download embeddable Python 3.11 (`python-3.11.x-embed-amd64.zip`) from
     python.org, extract to `build/python/`. Enable `site` by uncommenting
     the `python311._pth` line and shipping `get-pip.py`.
   - Create venv-equivalent layout: `build/python/Scripts/`, `build/python/Lib/site-packages/`.
   - `python -m pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`.
   - `python -m pip install .` (puts `unicorn-viz.exe` into `Scripts/`).
   - Download static ffmpeg build (gyan.dev) and stage into `build/ffmpeg/`.
   - Copy `assets/`, `unicornviz/`, `config.full.example.toml`, `README.md`,
     `LICENSE` into `build/payload/`.
3. `ISCC.exe packaging/windows/UnicornViz.iss /DAppVersion=${VERSION}` produces
   `UnicornViz-Setup-${VERSION}.exe`.
4. A separate job zips `build/payload/` as `UnicornViz-Portable-${VERSION}.zip`
   for users who can't run installers.

### 7.3 Inno Setup script changes

(`Check: NeedsAddPath` is a Pascal Script helper to avoid duplicating PATH

### 7.4 Things removed from the current Windows flow

- `tools/install_windows.bat`, `tools/install_windows.ps1`,
  `tools/install_windows_gui.ps1` move under `tools/dev/windows/` and are
  marked **developer-only** (running from a git clone). End users never see
  them.
- The current `[Files] Source: "{#RepoRoot}\*"` blanket copy is replaced by
  the curated `build/payload` staging in §8.2 so we never ship `.git/`,
  `.venv/`, screenshots, logs, audit docs, or drop-in dev scratch files into
  Program Files.

### 7.5 Start-menu / taskbar requirements

- `Icons` section above creates Start-menu entries automatically.
- Taskbar pinning is offered as an optional task; the actual pin happens via
  a small PowerShell helper (`tools/packaging/windows/pin_taskbar.ps1`)
  invoked from `[Run]` when the user opts in. Windows 11 made programmatic
  pinning harder; if the helper fails we silently no-op and rely on the user
  right-clicking the Start tile.
- The app's `StartupWMClass` Linux equivalent on Windows is the
  `AppUserModelID`. We set it inside `unicornviz/app.py` via
  `ctypes.windll.shell32.SetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID("io.unicornviz.UnicornViz")`
  so taskbar grouping uses the right icon.

### 7.6 Future: MSIX

Once the EV cert is in place, evaluate MSIX packaging to enable Microsoft
Store distribution. Deferred to v1.2.

## 9. CI Architecture

> GitHub Releases to R2 (`aws s3 sync --endpoint-url …`). `installer-smoke.yml`
> (nightly, real clean-container installs) is live and stays. The macOS and
> Windows build jobs remain the free way to build those two platforms.

```

```

### 8.2 Cross-repo publishing

The dev repo (`iDoMeteor/unicorn-viz`) runs the build matrix. A PAT stored as
`DJUNICORNTEARS_RELEASE_TOKEN` (scoped to `contents:write` on the canonical
repo) is used to create the release there. Alternatively, mirror the tag into
`djunicorntears/unicorn-viz` and run the same workflow on that repo. The
mirror approach is preferred long-term so the public repo is the single
source of truth for releases.

### 8.3 Nightly smoke matrix

`installer-smoke.yml` runs every night against the latest release artifacts:

| Job                  | Environment                | Checks                                |

| bash-installer-ubuntu| `ubuntu:24.04` container   | Runs `install.sh`, asserts `unicorn-viz --help` works |
| bash-installer-fedora| `fedora:41` container      | Same                                  |

## 10. Signing & Trust

| Artifact                  | Signing plan                                                  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub Release files      | `SHA256SUMS` + `SHA256SUMS.asc` (GPG) signed by release key   |
| `.deb`                    | `dpkg-sig` with the same GPG key                              |
| `.rpm`                    | `rpm --addsign` with the same GPG key                         |
| Flatpak                   | Flathub signs at their end                                    |
| Snap                      | Snap Store signs at their end                                 |
| Windows `.exe`            | `signtool` with OV code-signing cert (EV upgrade in v1.1)     |
| macOS `.dmg` / `.app`     | **v1: unsigned.** Post-launch: Developer ID + notarization (see §11.4) |
| `install.sh`              | Optional GPG detached sig at `install.sh.asc`                 |

GPG key: create a long-lived `release@unicornviz.io` (or equivalent) key,
publish the public key in the repo (`docs/release-key.asc`) and on
`keys.openpgp.org`. Document fingerprint in `SECURITY.md`.

Code-signing cert acquisition (Windows OV cert, future Apple Developer ID)
is an owner-action item (not an agent task). The Windows `SignTool` and
macOS `codesign`/`notarytool` steps are both gated on their respective
secrets being present in CI \u2014 if a secret is unset, the job builds an
unsigned artifact and prints a loud WARN rather than failing the release.
This keeps the pipeline live during v1 and lets us flip each signature on
the day its cert lands.

---

## 11. macOS

First-class delivery target alongside Linux and Windows. v1 ships
**unsigned**; full Developer ID signing + notarization is deferred until
revenue is in (see §0 decisions).

### 11.1 Deliverables

- `UnicornViz-X.Y.Z.dmg` — drag-to-`/Applications` disk image containing
  `Unicorn Viz.app`, a `universal2` bundle (arm64 + x86_64) so a single
  artifact covers Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.
- A Homebrew **cask** in the `djunicorntears/homebrew-unicornviz` tap repo
  (Homebrew SOP: the repo must be named `homebrew-<tap-name>` so users can
  type `brew tap djunicorntears/unicornviz`). Install with:
  `brew tap djunicorntears/unicornviz && brew install --cask unicorn-viz`.
  The cask formula is auto-bumped by CI on each stable tag via
  `dawidd6/action-homebrew-bump-formula`.

### 11.2 Toolchain

- **[`briefcase`](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/)** (BeeWare) is the
  primary bundler. It already understands macOS app bundles, code signing,
  notarization, and universal2 wheels, and supports our exact stack
  (Python + native deps + asset folders). `py2app` is a fallback if briefcase
  hits a wall with `python-rtmidi` or `moderngl`.
- Build on the `macos-14` GitHub runner (Apple Silicon, with `arch -x86_64`
  cross builds for the Intel slice via `delocate` and `lipo`).
- Embedded Python: `python-build-standalone` universal2 build, same family
  as the one we ship inside `.deb`/`.rpm`/Windows installer — keeps the
  runtime story uniform across all five desktop platforms.

### 11.3 Bundle structure

```
Unicorn Viz.app/
  Contents/
    Info.plist            CFBundleIdentifier = io.unicornviz.UnicornViz
                          LSMinimumSystemVersion = 12.0
                          NSMicrophoneUsageDescription = "Unicorn Viz captures audio for visualization."
                          NSCameraUsageDescription   = "Unicorn Viz uses the webcam for the webcam-01 drop-in."
    MacOS/UnicornViz      tiny launcher stub → runtime/bin/unicorn-viz
    Resources/
      unicorn-viz.icns    multi-resolution icon generated from assets/icons/unicorn-viz.png
      app/                unicornviz/ package + assets/ (core only — no drop-ins; see §6)
    Frameworks/
      Python.framework/   embedded universal2 Python 3.11
    runtime/              venv-equivalent with site-packages installed
```

### 11.4 Signing & notarization (v1: deferred)

v1 ships unsigned. The README's macOS section gets an unmissable "Right-click
open the first time" Gatekeeper workaround block, plus the `xattr -dr
com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Unicorn\ Viz.app` one-liner for users
who already double-clicked and got the quarantine bit.

When we revisit this post-launch:

- Developer ID Application certificate stored as a base64 secret
  (`MACOS_CERT_P12` + `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD`).
- Sign with `codesign --options=runtime --entitlements packaging/macos/entitlements.plist`.
- Notarize with `xcrun notarytool submit --wait` using
  `APPLE_ID` / `APPLE_TEAM_ID` / `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` secrets.
- Staple the ticket with `xcrun stapler staple` before producing the `.dmg`.
- The Windows-style "gated on cert presence in CI" pattern from §10 applies:
  if the macOS certificate secret is unset, the job builds an unsigned
  `.dmg` and prints a loud WARN. This keeps the pipeline live during v1
  and lets us flip the switch the day the cert lands.
- Required entitlements once we sign:
  - `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` (microphone for audio capture)
  - `com.apple.security.device.camera` (webcam drop-in)
  - `com.apple.security.device.usb` (USB-MIDI controllers)
  - `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` (moderngl shader compilation backends)
  - `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` (loading the bundled
    `python-rtmidi` / `sounddevice` dylibs that aren't signed by Apple)

### 11.5 Menu / dock integration

Native `.app` bundles get menu-bar, Dock, and Spotlight integration for free.
The unicorn avatar (`assets/icons/unicorn-viz.png`) is converted at build time
to a multi-resolution `.icns` (16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024) via
`iconutil`. No extra desktop-entry plumbing needed.

### 11.6 Platform-specific runtime notes

- Audio: `sounddevice` uses CoreAudio on macOS. PipeWire-specific defaults in
  `config.toml` are already optional; the macOS-shipped `config.toml` template
  picks the default CoreAudio device.
- MIDI: `python-rtmidi` uses CoreMIDI. Works under sandbox with the
  `device.usb` entitlement above.
- OpenGL: macOS 10.14+ deprecated OpenGL. 3.3 core still works through the
  legacy compatibility layer on macOS 12–15, but Apple may remove it.
  **Risk to track:** moving the renderer to Metal via `moderngl-window`'s
  `pyglet`/`glfw`/MoltenGL path or a future Metal backend is a v1.2 concern,
  not blocking for v1.
- Wayland-only code paths must remain optional. Audit `unicornviz/app.py`
  and the drop-ins for Linux-only `os.environ` assumptions before the first
  macOS build.

### 11.7 Open Mac-specific risks

1. `python-rtmidi` wheels for `universal2` may not be on PyPI; if not, we
   compile from source in CI (adds ~2 minutes per build).
2. The webcam drop-in (`webcam-01`) uses OpenCV or a custom V4L2 path —
   confirm AVFoundation path exists, or guard the drop-in as Linux-only on
   macOS until ported.
3. Drop-ins that shell out to ffmpeg need the bundled ffmpeg binary copied
   into `Contents/Frameworks/ffmpeg` and added to `PATH` in the launcher stub.

---

## 12. Mobile (Android & iOS) — Feasibility Evaluation

**Recommendation: not planned for v1. Treat as a separate product line, not
a port.**

This section exists so we have a written assessment before someone asks
"why not just briefcase it?" The honest answer is that mobile is a
fundamentally different product, and the lift is well above what "installer
team" implies.

### 11.1 What technically works today

- **BeeWare briefcase** has Android (via Chaquopy) and iOS targets and can
  bundle a Python interpreter into both. Hello-world apps are real and ship.
- **Kivy / KivyMD** + **python-for-android** / **kivy-ios** also bundle
  Python apps into APK/IPA.
- **PyOpenGL ES** bindings exist on both platforms.

So a *Python visualizer* on mobile is not science-fiction. The hard parts
are what's specific to **our** stack and **our** product.

### 11.2 What does not port cleanly

| Subsystem            | Status on Android                       | Status on iOS                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `moderngl` (GL 3.3 core, desktop GL) | ❌ Mobile is GLES 3.x — every shader needs rewriting (`#version 330` → `#version 300 es`, `texture2D` semantics, precision qualifiers, no `double`) | ❌ Same; plus Apple has deprecated GL in favor of Metal |
| `pysdl2` + `pysdl2-dll` | ⚠️ SDL2 builds for Android exist but the Python bindings + DLL wheel do not — would need a custom Gradle integration | ⚠️ Same, plus App Store review concerns around interpreted code |
| `sounddevice` (PortAudio) | ❌ No PortAudio backend; would need to swap to AAudio/OpenSL ES via a different library | ❌ No PortAudio; needs AVAudioEngine bridge |
| `python-rtmidi` (ALSA/CoreMIDI/WinMM) | ⚠️ Android MIDI is a totally different API (`android.media.midi`) — needs a new backend | ⚠️ iOS uses CoreMIDI but `python-rtmidi` is not packaged for iOS wheels |
| `numpy` / `scipy` FFT | ✅ Available via briefcase/kivy recipes | ✅ Available via kivy-ios recipes      |
| Fullscreen + always-on display | ⚠️ Trivial flag, but battery/thermals on a phone GPU running 60fps shaders for an hour is brutal | ⚠️ Same, plus iOS aggressively throttles background audio |
| ANSI / CP437 font asset | ✅ Pure-data, ships fine                | ✅ Same                                 |
| Drop-in submodule architecture | ⚠️ Runtime `importlib` from arbitrary paths conflicts with Android's APK assets model and iOS code-signing | ❌ Apple forbids downloading and executing new code post-install (drop-in hot-loading would not pass App Store review) |

### 11.3 Effort estimate (rough order of magnitude)

- **Android MVP** (one effect, audio-reactive from device mic, no MIDI,
  no drop-ins, GLES 3 port of the simplest shader, briefcase packaging):
  weeks of focused work, not days.
- **iOS MVP** with the same scope: same order of magnitude, plus Apple
  developer account, App Store review, and a Metal-or-MoltenGL decision.
- **Feature parity with desktop** (full drop-in catalog, MIDI, recording,
  postfx chains, control room): multi-month rewrite of the renderer and
  the audio/MIDI layer. Probably more code than the current desktop app.

### 11.4 If we ever do it

The right architecture is **not** "port the installer" — it's:

1. Extract a `unicornviz-core` package with shaders, palette logic, beat
   detection, scene sequencing, and ANSI rendering — anything that's not
   platform glue.
2. Build a thin mobile shell (likely Kotlin/Swift, or a Flutter/React Native
   wrapper if a JS/TS shader runtime is acceptable) that consumes
   `unicornviz-core` either via Chaquopy (Android) or by re-implementing
   the shader feed on the native side.
3. Ship a curated, sandbox-safe subset of effects. Drop-in hot-loading is
   off the table on iOS and impractical on Android.

Tracked as a future product spike under `docs/planning/mobile.md` when (and
if) we decide to invest.

### 11.5 What we will do now

- Keep `unicornviz/` core code reasonably platform-agnostic (no Linux-only
  imports at module load time outside guarded blocks).
- Avoid baking PipeWire / ALSA assumptions into shared modules.
- That's it. No mobile-specific installer work in this plan.

---

## 13. Documentation Updates

Once installer artifacts are live, rewrite the "Install" sections of:

- `README.md` — replace the manual `git clone` recipes with the one-liner,
  the `.deb`/`.rpm` download links, the Flathub badge, the Snap Store badge,
  and the Windows installer download link.
- `docs/user-guide.md` — same, with per-platform screenshots of the menu
  entry and the running app.
- `docs/configuration.md` — note where `config.toml` lives per install
  method (`~/.config/unicorn-viz/config.toml` for system installs;
  `<prefix>/config.toml` for portable / bash-installed; XDG portal location
  for sandboxed installs).

These doc updates are part of the same PR that lands each delivery channel,
not a separate cleanup pass.

## 14. Milestones

> **Superseded by §16 (2026-06-21).** This table is kept for history. It assumed
> an "installers team" and channel-at-a-time delivery. The active plan is the
> solo-dev, foundation-first roadmap in §16, which front-loads the shared
> `python-build-standalone` runtime and payload work so multiple channels reach
> ★3 together. Read §16 for current sequencing; treat the table below as the
> original sketch.

| Milestone | Scope                                                              | Exit criteria                                    |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **M1** — Bash installer    | §3 only                                          | `curl … \| bash` works on Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, Debian 12, Fedora 40/41, Arch; nightly smoke green |
| **M2** — Native packages   | §4                                               | `.deb` + `.rpm` for all matrix targets attached to a real tagged release; nightly install smoke green |
| **M3** — Windows installer | §8                                               | Signed (or clearly unsigned with warning) `.exe` produces a working Start-menu entry on Win10/Win11 |
| **M4** — macOS `.dmg`      | §11                                              | Unsigned universal2 `.dmg` installs into `/Applications`; Spotlight/Dock entry works on Apple Silicon and Intel; Homebrew cask published in `djunicorntears/homebrew-unicornviz`; README documents the Gatekeeper workaround. (Notarization deferred — see §0.) |
| **M5** — Flatpak           | §5.1                                             | Local `flatpak install` works end-to-end; Flathub submission PR open |
| **M6** — Snap              | §5.2                                             | `snap install --edge unicorn-viz` works under strict confinement |
| **M7** — Polish            | Signing, repo hosting, docs sweep, MSIX eval     | All channels signed; README rewritten; v1.0 tag |

Each milestone is one PR (or a small stack) so the canonical repo gets a
clean, reviewable history.

## 15. Open Questions for the Owner

*(Updated 2026-05-22 with answers. Items marked **OPEN** still need input.)*

1. ~~Public domain~~ — **Resolved:** `unicornviz.io` will be wired up;
   `get.unicornviz.io` redirects to the raw `install.sh` on the canonical
   repo. A second domain is planned (TBD). GitHub CLI plumbing for the
   `djunicorntears` org is parked until the correct GitHub account is the
   active login.
2. ~~Code-signing publisher name~~ — **Resolved:** `Unicorn Viz`.
3. ~~Snap / Flathub handle ownership~~ — **Action item, not yet resolved:**
   both `unicorn-viz` on Snap Store and `io.unicornviz.UnicornViz` on
   Flathub still need to be claimed. Blocks M5 and M6 ship.
4. ~~Bundle `python-build-standalone` everywhere?~~ — **Resolved: yes**, on
   every Linux package and every desktop installer.
5. ~~Drop-ins in release tarball?~~ — **Resolved: core only.** Drop-ins ship
   separately (see §6).
6. ~~Apple Developer ID for macOS notarization?~~ — **Resolved: deferred**
   post-launch. v1 ships an unsigned `.dmg` with Gatekeeper workaround docs.
7. **OPEN — macOS minimum version:** recommendation is macOS 12 (Monterey).
   Confirm or bump.
8. ~~Homebrew tap repo name~~ — **Resolved:**
   `djunicorntears/homebrew-unicornviz` (Homebrew SOP: the GitHub repo must
   be named `homebrew-<tap>`; the user-facing tap command is
   `brew tap djunicorntears/unicornviz`).
9. ~~Mobile in v1?~~ — **Resolved: no.** Android/iOS explicitly out of scope.

### Remaining owner action items (not blocking the plan, but blocking ship)

- Log in to GitHub CLI as the `djunicorntears` owner so release automation,
  Pages setup for the bash installer, and Homebrew tap creation can proceed.
- Register / claim:
  - DNS for `unicornviz.io` and the planned second domain.
  - `unicorn-viz` snap name on the Snap Store.
  - `io.unicornviz.UnicornViz` app ID on Flathub.
  - `djunicorntears/homebrew-unicornviz` GitHub repository.
- Decide macOS minimum version (Q7 above).

## 16. Solo-Dev Phased Roadmap to Five Gold Stars (2026-06-21)

This is the authoritative plan. It replaces the §14 milestone sketch. Design
constraints, stated plainly:

- **One person.** No parallel "teams." Phases are sequential and each ends in a
  shippable, reviewable PR (or small stack), per the repo's commit conventions.
- **No budget except, maybe, store/signing fees.** Every tool below is free on
  public-repo GitHub Actions (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-2022`, `macos-14` are all
  free for public repos), plus free OSS packagers (`fpm`, Inno Setup, `briefcase`,
  `flatpak-builder`, `snapcraft`). The only spend is itemized in §17 and every
  paid item is deferrable behind the unsigned-but-documented escape hatch (§0.5.1).
- **Foundation first.** The two cross-cutting levers (bundled runtime + curated
  payload) are built once in Phase 0 so four channels climb to ★3 together.
- **Ship the cheapest reach first.** The Linux one-liner is already ★3 and reaches
  the widest audience for the least work, so it leads. Windows is the most users
  but the biggest rework, so it follows the runtime/payload foundation.

### Progress log

- **2026-09-30 — W1/W2 (installer seat `uv-install`): free-threaded runtime,
  wheelhouse wiring, drop-in dependencies (core beta.185).**
  - **Runtime.** `fetch_runtime.sh --flavor gil|ft` (`UV_RUNTIME_FLAVOR`).
    `ft` is python-build-standalone 20260929, CPython 3.14.7,
    `freethreaded-install_only` (ABI `cp314t`). Digests are pinned for
    linux/windows/macos on x86-64 and aarch64, normal and `_stripped`. PBS no
    longer publishes per-asset `.sha256` files, so the old "warn and skip when the
    checksum is missing" silently turned verification off. It is now fatal:
    pin, then release `SHA256SUMS`, then legacy sidecar, else refuse
    (`UV_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_RUNTIME=1` to override). `tests/test_fetch_runtime.py`
    runs offline against a stub `curl`.
  - **Wheelhouse.** UV Threads' cp314t wheels live in the append-only
    `~/projects/_software-dist/wheelhouse/cp314t/` with `SHA256SUMS`.
    `stage_payload.sh` copies them into `<payload>/wheelhouse/` after checking
    every wheel against the sums (`--wheelhouse`, `--no-wheelhouse`, default
    `$UV_WHEELHOUSE` or that folder). All installers pass the payload's
    `wheelhouse/` to pip as `--find-links`. **Flavor choice:** Linux
    installers default to `ft` only on x86-64 *and* when a wheelhouse is
    present (`uv_runtime_flavor`); a plain git checkout with no wheelhouse (CI,
    the nightly installer smoke) stays on `gil`, since PyPI has no cp314t
    moderngl/glcontext/rtmidi/OpenCV. `install.sh` boots on the default flavor
    to read the manifest, then swaps the runtime after the download if the
    release carries a wheelhouse. `build_native.sh` has `--runtime-flavor`
    (default: `ft` when the staged payload has a wheelhouse).
  - **Open consequence.** A source tarball or rpm/deb built **in CI** has no
    wheelhouse (it is not in git), so it installs on `gil` 3.11 and W1 stays
    open for those artifacts. Release builds made on the owner's box pick the
    wheelhouse up automatically. To make CI releases free-threaded, the wheels
    must reach CI (release asset or a fetch step): owner decision.
  - **W2.** `lib.sh` (`uv_dropin_requirement_files`, `uv_pip_install_optional`)
    and `tools/install/dropin_deps.ps1` (dot-sourced by `install_windows.ps1`
    and `windows_deps.ps1`) install every drop-in's requirements: a packaged
    payload's `requirements-dropins.txt` if present, else each checked-out
    drop-in's `requirements.txt`. Each file is tried whole, then line by
    line; a requirement with no build is a warning and the drop-in runs without
    it. The root `requirements.txt` is a constraints file so a drop-in can't move
    a core pin. mediapipe is installed `--no-deps` (+ absl-py, flatbuffers):
    its chain pulls opencv-contrib-python over our cv2. `UV_NO_DROPIN_DEPS=1`
    skips all of it. The PowerShell side is untested here (no `pwsh` on this
    box). `build_windows_portable.sh` gained `--runtime-flavor gil|ft`
    (default `gil`, `UV_RUNTIME_FLAVOR`); `ft` cross-installs for `cp314t`, strict
    for the core set, per requirement for drop-ins.
  - **Verified (Linux, clean venv from the bundled PBS 3.14.7 ft runtime +
    wheelhouse):** root requirements install (moderngl, glcontext,
    python-rtmidi 1.5.8-1, OpenCV 4.13.0.92 all from the wheelhouse), the
    project installs, `sys._is_gil_enabled()` is `False` on the bare
    interpreter, `--self-test` reports OK. **Not yet verified:** app launch
    and a mixer track load on the clean install; the Windows bundle.
  - **Per-dependency table, Python 3.14t** (Linux: real `pip install` into the
    ft venv; Windows: pip cross-resolve `win_amd64`/`cp314t`, or `cp313` for the
    interim):

    | Dependency (needed by) | Linux 3.14t | Windows cp314t | Windows cp313 (GIL) |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | PySDL2, pysdl2-dll, sounddevice, soundfile, python-osc, Pillow, psutil, numpy, scipy | installs | installs | installs |
    | openai, anthropic (training only) | installs | installs | installs |
    | av (videos, postfx, mixer) | installs (19.0.0) | installs | installs (abi3) |
    | mutagen, python-vlc, send2trash, ably | installs | installs | installs |
    | hidapi (mixer, undeclared) | installs | installs | installs |
    | moderngl, glcontext | our wheel | **needs our wheel (GH Actions job)** | upstream |
    | python-rtmidi | our wheel | **needs our wheel** | **no wheel anywhere** |
    | opencv-python-headless | our wheel (PyPI is abi3-only) | **needs our wheel** | upstream (abi3) |
    | usd-core (sims) | installs (26.8, non-`t` wheel, import untested) | unverified | upstream |
    | demucs (mixer stems) | **fails: sphn builds from source and fails** | needs a sphn wheel (in the GH job) | upstream |
    | torch, torchaudio | cp314t wheels exist | cp314t wheels exist | upstream |
    | mediapipe (webcam) | untested; whole-file resolve backtracks, so `--no-deps` | untested | upstream, `--no-deps` |

    Note the earlier "torch on Windows resolution impossible" was an artifact
    of resolving cross-platform on a Linux host: pip evaluates `platform_system
    == "Linux"` markers (nvidia-nccl) for the host, not the target. Real
    Windows resolves.
  - **2026-10-01 update (core beta.189): Windows on free-threaded 3.14.** All
    five Windows cp314t wheels (glcontext, moderngl, python-rtmidi -1, sphn,
    OpenCV with its LGPL FFmpeg plugin) were built on GitHub Actions
    (`windows-ft-wheels.yml`, UV Threads' `build_windows_ft_wheels.py`) and
    published append-only as release `wheelhouse-cp314t-win-2026-10-01`
    (prerelease; notices attached); the Linux set is `wheelhouse-cp314t-2026-10-01`.
    `tools/packaging/wheelhouse-cp314t.sha256` lists both tags' wheels and is the
    only trust anchor (`fetch_wheelhouse.sh`, verified against the real releases:
    10 wheels). `stage_payload.sh --wheel-platform` filters by platform;
    `build_windows_portable.sh` now defaults to `--runtime-flavor ft`
    (`gil` = legacy 3.11) and drops the staged wheelhouse after installing.
    A core-only test bundle built clean (246 MB): PBS 3.14.7 free-threaded
    runtime with python.exe/pythonw.exe and the MSVC runtime DLLs, every
    compiled module tagged cp314t, cv2 plus `opencv_videoio_ffmpeg4130_64.dll`,
    no GIL-build `.pyd`. **Not run on Windows**: the owner needs to test the
    bundle (launch, `--self-test`, a mixer track load); expect the GIL log line
    to say the main process re-enabled the GIL (moderngl).
  - **2026-10-02: patched free-threading wheels.** All five packages were rebuilt by
    the upstream free-threading work with the GIL declaration and thread-safety
    fixes (rtmidi `-3`, glcontext `-2`, moderngl `-2`, sphn `-1`, OpenCV `-1`; Linux
    and Windows) and published as release `wheelhouse-cp314t-patched-2026-10-02`
    (prerelease, notices attached). `wheelhouse-cp314t.sha256` lists them under that
    tag; the earlier builds stay listed as the append-only record.
    `tools/packaging/wheel_select.py` keeps only the newest build of each wheel
    (highest version, then build tag), used by `fetch_wheelhouse.sh` (`--all` to
    fetch everything) and `stage_payload.sh`, so bundles don't carry both builds.
    License check before publishing: vendored libraries and license files identical
    to the predecessors in all ten pairs; sphn crate set carried over (same sdist,
    `--locked`, partial binary-path check by UV Threads).
  - **2026-10-02: installer-smoke, the real Windows installer, S3.**
    - *Smoke failures:* 09-23/09-29/09-30 were Docker pull rate limits on
      `public.ecr.aws` in the native-package-smoke job (flake; not fixed, a
      retry would be a workflow edit: owner/coordinator approval). 10-02 was a
      real regression: the Windows job builds core-only with no local wheelhouse,
      and the free-threaded default found no cp314t moderngl. Fix:
      `build_windows_portable.sh` fetches the verified win_amd64 wheels itself
      when none are staged. The first CI runs of that fetch exposed two more bugs
      (CRLF trust file on a Windows checkout; a broken `python3` selecting no
      wheels), both fixed with tests. Result: run 37061421322, all jobs green,
      including the portable zip and the **silently installed Inno installer
      passing `--self-test` on a real windows-2022 runner on the free-threaded
      runtime**.
    - *Installer exe:* built by that run (version beta.194):
      `UnicornViz-Setup-1.0.0-beta.194-CORE-ONLY-ft-from-CI.exe`, kept in
      `_software-dist`. Uploaded to `s3://ut-software-dist/` with `.sha256`
      sidecars, plus the beta.192 ft portable zip; `unicorn-viz-latest.exe`
      (which had been the beta.190 *zip* renamed) now points at the Setup exe.
      The bucket is versioned, so the replaced object is still retrievable. Public
      URLs: `https://ut-software-dist.s3.amazonaws.com/<key>` (public-read policy);
      `software.unicornviz.com` (CloudFront) returned 403 for every key when checked.
  - **2026-10-05: nightly runs paused (owner).** `installer-smoke.yml` no longer has
    a `schedule:`; it runs only by hand (`gh workflow run installer-smoke.yml`).
    `compat-matrix.yml`, `release-installers.yml` and `windows-ft-wheels.yml` were
    already manual/tag-only. GitHub's own CodeQL default setup still runs weekly
    (a repository setting, not a workflow file; left as is pending the owner).
    The earlier "nightly" wording in this plan is historical.
  - **Where we stopped / next.**
    1. *(Written 2026-10-01, `.github/workflows/windows-ft-wheels.yml`; dispatch
       with `only=sphn` first, then the trio, then OpenCV.)* Write `.github/workflows/windows-ft-wheels.yml` (owner approved a GH
       job for the Windows wheels, 3.13 interim if it fails): `workflow_dispatch`
       with an optional `only` input, `windows-2022`, 150 min, runs
       `python tools/packaging/build_windows_ft_wheels.py --out wheels-out
       --work work` (UV Threads' script, interface agreed), uploads artifact
       `cp314t-win_amd64-wheels`. Wait for UV Threads' script to land first.
    2. Then `import_gh_wheels.sh` (append-only copy + SHA256SUMS), flip
       `build_windows_portable.sh` to `ft` by default, build and verify the
       Windows bundle on the owner's machine.
    3. Finish the Linux clean-install check: launch the app, load a mixer
       track, confirm the GIL-state log line. UV Threads' Linux cp314t `sphn`
       wheel landed in the wheelhouse after this entry's demucs probe, so
       re-run the dj-mixer-01 requirements install (`uv_pip_install_optional`
       against `drop-ins/dj-mixer-01/requirements.txt`, wheelhouse on
       `--find-links`; it pulls ~2 GB of CUDA torch wheels, pip cache in
       `/var/tmp/uv-install-clean/pipcache` if still present): demucs should
       now install. Otherwise the mixer's `stems_python` can point at a second,
       GIL interpreter.
    4. Owner decision: how CI release builds get the wheelhouse. *(Decided
       2026-10-01: publish the wheels as a GitHub release asset and fetch them in
       CI against a committed SHA256SUMS.)*
    4a. *(2026-10-01, landed)* Wheelhouse release `wheelhouse-cp314t-2026-10-01`
       (prerelease, no app tag; five Linux wheels + SHA256SUMS, licenses and the
       OpenCV LGPL source pointers in its notes). `release-installers.yml` runs
       `tools/packaging/fetch_wheelhouse.sh` before the source tarball is
       repacked with `wheelhouse/` and before `build_native.sh`
       (`UV_WHEELHOUSE`); trust anchor is the committed
       `tools/packaging/wheelhouse-cp314t.sha256`, never the release's own
       sums. (Dry-run dispatch for the workflow: `version` / `source_ref` inputs,
       owner-approved 2026-10-01; publishing stays gated on a `v*.*.*` tag,
       guarded by `tests/test_release_workflow.py`.) Windows wheels: append
       lines (and a new `# release-tag:`) to the trust file when they exist.
    5. *(2026-10-01)* Linux installers install **CPU-only torch/torchaudio**
       before demucs (`uv_preinstall_cpu_torch`, PyTorch CPU index, cp314t
       wheels exist for Linux and Windows): the mixer-dependency venv is 1.4 GB
       instead of 6.0 GB with the default CUDA wheels. `UV_TORCH_CUDA=1` opts
       back into CUDA. Windows/macOS PyPI torch is already CPU.
    5. Drop-in owners: dj-mixer-01 should declare hidapi and send2trash (or use
       the pack file's `+hidapi +send2trash`); the self-test lists drop-in
       dependency gaps.

- **2026-09-19 (II) — Fullscreen Optimizations diagnosis disproven by the
  owner's own test; reverted (core beta.154). New lead: the launch chain
  itself, never examined until now.** Owner manually disabled "Fullscreen
  optimizations" for `pythonw.exe` via Explorer Properties > Compatibility
  on beta.152, rebooted, relaunched — no change at all. That's the exact
  mechanism beta.153's registry write was going to flip automatically, so
  the whole diagnosis was wrong; beta.154 reverts it outright (`git revert
  efd1d50`, not a rewrite) rather than leave dead-weight code behind.
  Lesson for next time: do the free 30-second manual UI test *before*
  writing the automated version, not after — this time it happened to be
  offered first and the owner ran it, which is exactly why this got
  caught before another round of "ship and wait."
  - **Owner's own lead, unexamined until now: the launch/install process
    itself changed.** Direct answer to "is this version even installing
    anything": no. Every flashing report to date — every log path across
    every beta — is under a Desktop-unzipped `UnicornViz-Portable-*\`
    folder, i.e. the **portable zip**, which is not an installer at all
    (no registry, no Program Files, no Start Menu, no uninstaller — a
    self-contained folder, delete it and it's gone). The separate Inno
    Setup `.exe` (real install: Program Files or per-user via
    `PrivilegesRequired=lowest`, Start Menu/Desktop shortcuts, PATH task,
    a real uninstaller) has never actually been the thing under test.
    Both paths, though, end up running the bundled interpreter the same
    detached way (see below), so this isn't "test the installer instead"
    — it's specifically about how the process gets spawned, which is
    shared by both.
  - **Timeline, checked precisely via git, not memory:** `unicorn-viz.cmd`
    started handing a no-argument double-click off to `pythonw.exe` via
    `start ""` in **beta.120** (`20e747b`, 2026-09-09 — the "terminal
    background" tester-note fix). Before that, beta.118/119 ran
    `python.exe` directly, console attached. Cross-referencing this doc's
    own contemporaneous entries: beta.118/119's documented issues were
    both **boot-time-only** (webcam camera probe, hw-encoder probe) — no
    focus/Alt+Tab pattern was ever reported against them. The "fine until
    I do something else, Alt+Tab / Win key" framing first appears against
    **beta.124** — after the `pythonw.exe`-via-`start` change. Not proof
    (nobody may have specifically tried Alt+Tab before beta.124 either),
    but a real, checkable correlation, and the two mechanisms already
    tried (swap interval, Fullscreen Optimizations) both predate or are
    unrelated to this change and neither fixed anything.
  - **Why this is plausible, not just a coincidence of timing:** Windows'
    `SetForegroundWindow` is deliberately restricted — a process only
    keeps foreground-activation rights in a specific set of cases,
    including "was started by the current foreground process"
    (`learn.microsoft.com/.../nf-winuser-setforegroundwindow`). `start`
    (cmd) and `Start-Process` (PowerShell, used by the installer's
    `tools\unicorn-viz-gui.ps1`) both detach the child; whether that
    detachment preserves foreground-activation rights for the grandchild
    (`pythonw.exe`) is exactly the kind of thing that silently breaks.
    SDL itself has a documented Windows bug in the same family:
    "Fullscreen windows stuck on top after Alt+Tab focus loss"
    (github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/5509). This would explain a
    focus-triggered repeated mode-reset independent of DWM Fullscreen
    Optimizations, matching the owner's disconfirming test.
  - **Not shipped as a fix — proposed as the next cheap isolation test**,
    learning from the beta.153 mistake: a debug launcher variant that
    runs the interpreter directly with no `start`/`Start-Process`
    detachment hop (console visible again, temporarily) to test whether
    removing that hop alone changes the behavior, before writing any
    "fix" claiming to address it.
- **2026-09-18 (II) — root-caused and reversed against the whole
  installer-break window (core beta.152).** Owner asked for an outline of
  every rendering-pipeline change made during their August break, since the
  Windows flashing/TV-signal-loss saga started once they resumed installer
  testing. Traced it: installer-path commits stop 2026-08-08, resume
  2026-09-04; every render-pipeline change in that gap was diagnosed and
  validated from one live capture on the owner's own 3-display Linux mirror
  rig (`performance-remediation-plan-2026-08-08.md`), zero Windows testing.
  Two confirmed causes, both already found via stall dumps and both
  Windows-special-cased days ago (beta.124 swap-interval clamp, beta.125
  borderless fullscreen) — this entry is the paper trail connecting them to
  their actual origin, plus the owner's decision on each:
  - **`fullscreen_mode`**: the borderless-vs-`SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP`
    branch traces to 2026-05-12 (`8a07548`, see
    `drop-ins/multi-head-01/MATE-X11-MULTIHEAD-NOTES.md`) — added because
    Marco/MATE on X11 ignores SDL fullscreen placement hints, reproduced on
    Fedora 44/MATE. Checked this box directly: it's Fedora 44 **GNOME**/
    Wayland, so the MATE branch is currently inactive here regardless —
    `FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP` is what's been running on the owner's own daily
    session the whole time, uneventfully. Owner call: keep the Linux logic
    exactly as is (real, reproduced reason; inert on this box either way);
    Windows already forced to borderless unconditionally since beta.125 —
    no further change needed.
  - **`[render] fps_limit`**: traces to 2026-08-08 (`ea964f7`, core
    beta.60) — the *first* time this app ever called
    `SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval` at all, defaulted to a locked 30 to steady a
    ~35 ms/frame measurement under mirror+webcam load on an integrated
    GPU. Owner call: revert the default to `0` (follow vsync) everywhere,
    not just Windows — core beta.152. The setting and the Windows interval
    clamp both stay (defense in depth for anyone who opts back into a
    non-zero cap); it just is not the default on any platform any more.
    Two tests added.
  - **Not yet resolved, lower priority**: the secondary-window present-
    guard's per-frame `SDL_GL_MakeCurrent` rebind (mechanism predates the
    break, May/July; its skip threshold was retuned in it, Aug 8) is
    Wayland-motivated per its own docstring and has never been checked on
    Windows WGL. Test plan if flashing persists after this: `stall_dump_s
    = 1.0` + `perf_frames = true` on the *current* build (every earlier
    dump predates both fixes), with the mixer/control-room window open vs.
    fully closed to isolate this path.
  - Owner: "repository at rest and everything else running super smooth,
    after we fix this and test, our RC1 is just about ready."
- **2026-09-18 — Windows DJ pack drops `midi-controllers-01`, swaps
  `effects-retro` for `effects-ukiyo-e`; both packs repackaged from
  current code.** Owner call: 17 drop-ins now (was 18; correcting this
  entry's earlier "16" — one dropped, one swapped 1-for-1 is a net change
  of one, not two). Confirmed `effects-ukiyo-e` has no extra dependencies
  (four effects, no requirements.txt) before adding it. `windows-general.txt`
  is unchanged.
- **2026-09-16 — Windows DJ pack drops `webcam-01` and `multi-head-01`;
  both packs repackaged from current code (core beta.149).** Owner call:
  the DJ testers don't need the camera overlay or the second-screen
  controller, and dropping them shrinks the bundle and removes two more
  moving parts from an already-large pack. `packaging/dropins/windows-djs.txt`
  now lists 18 drop-ins (was 20); `windows-general.txt` is unchanged (it
  never carried either). Repackaged both zips against the current tree —
  three weeks of drop-in work since the 2026-09-09 baseline, including the
  quit-dialog restore, the Windows swap-interval/fullscreen fixes, the
  font-resolver fixes in dj-mixer-01/midi-controllers-01, banner-01
  defaulting off, the owner-state test-leak fixes, and the Config Editor
  2.0 initiative (core beta.144-148).
- **2026-09-12 — quit dialog restored (core beta.136).** The native yes/no
  box replaced by beta.121's two-press prompt is back by owner decision: that
  change was chasing the Windows stalls, which were the swap interval and the
  fullscreen flag, and the prompt was a worse experience. With Windows
  fullscreen now borderless the dialog is composited and reachable.
- **2026-09-09 (night IV) — beta.124 still bad, now with a sharper shape:
  fine until Alt+Tab / Win key, then drastic.** No logs this time (the
  debug block was not copied over). That shape is Windows' fullscreen
  handling: with `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP` Windows classifies the app
  as a fullscreen game (fullscreen optimizations, flip presentation) and
  every focus change flips the display path — on this 5-display Intel box a
  mode transition the TV reads as signal loss, with the loop stalled in the
  driver meanwhile. Earlier tonight's focus-shaped stalls were the same
  path under a swap interval of 2.
  - **Fix, core 1.0.0-beta.125:** on Windows `fullscreen` is a borderless
    window covering the display (the `fullscreen_mode = "borderless"` path
    that already existed for MATE); `"desktop"` opts back in. Documented in
    the full example config; test added.
  - **Instrument for the next run (copy into config.toml):** `[logging]
    level = "debug"`, `perf_frames = true`, `stall_dump_s = 1.0`. Without
    it a bad run is a description, not evidence.
- **2026-09-09 (night III) — found it: the swap interval. beta.123 stall
  dumps (`stall_dump_s = 1.0`, 129 dumps over two runs, recording and audio
  fallback disabled, then everything non-essential unplugged).** In every
  dump the main thread is blocked inside a *native* call — ~half in
  `SDL_PollEvent`, ~half in a moderngl `Buffer.write` in the Audio Spectrum
  effect's render — never in Python, and every other thread is idle in a
  wait. The perf timeline is focus-shaped: 30 fps while the tour is up or
  while another window is foreground, ~2 s per frame the moment the
  visualizer is foreground. That is the GL driver's deferred vblank wait:
  the 30 fps cap (added 2026-08-08, `[render] fps_limit`, i.e. "weeks ago")
  is implemented as `SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval(2)`, and under desktop
  composition the Intel Windows driver (31.0.101.3729 on this NUC) serviced
  "every 2nd vblank" as a ~1 s wait surfacing at the next GL call and in the
  message pump; background windows are not composited, so they ran free.
  It was never the audio system, ffmpeg, the webcam, or the controllers.
  - **Fix, core 1.0.0-beta.124:** on Windows the interval is clamped to 1
    (logged); Linux keeps the exact vblank-divided cap. Test added.
  - **Config-only confirmation on beta.123:** `[render] fps_limit = 0`
    (interval 1). Owner also noted the Intel driver on the NUC was never
    updated; do that too, but the clamp stays — testers' drivers vary.
  - **Method note:** three rounds of "fix the thing that looks guilty" (the
    quit dialog, the encoder probe) each removed a real problem yet not the
    symptom. The thread dump settled it in one run. For the next Windows
    stall, start from `stall_dump_s = 1.0` + `perf_frames = true`.
- **2026-09-09 (night II) — beta.121 DJ run: same blackouts, now with
  debug + perf frames. Root cause found: the boot-time hardware-encoder
  probe.** The second run's `Perf frame` lines show the loop at **~1 fps for
  ~35 s right after load** (`total≈1000 ms`, `events≈500-700 ms`,
  `draw≈400-500 ms`) in two stretches that line up exactly with the
  recording probe: nvenc fails in 1 s (no `nvcuda.dll`), then the **VA-API
  probe runs 17 s** (a Linux API, on Windows), then the **QSV probe runs to
  its 20 s timeout and ffmpeg dies** — the "ffmpeg crash" dialog the owner
  saw. Each probe is a real ffmpeg encode on the same Iris Xe the visualizer
  is drawing with; the display starves, DWM shows black, the TV drops. The
  beta.119/120 runs had the same stall (QSV *succeeded* there after ~25 s).
  Box: ffmpeg 8.1.1 (Gyan full build, libvpl) via winget on PATH.
  - **Fix, core 1.0.0-beta.122:** the boot prewarm runs only when
    `[recording] auto_record` is true (otherwise the probe waits for the first
    record press, as it used to); VA-API is never a candidate on Windows or
    macOS. Tests added. **For the recording seat:** even lazily, the probe can
    starve the display for up to 40 s on Intel iGPUs — consider QSV-only on
    Windows with a short timeout, or a software-first default there.
  - **Owner call, core beta.123:** on Windows the probe tries NVENC and QSV
    only (NVENC answers in ~1 s without an NVIDIA driver and is the win for
    NVIDIA boxes), with a 6 s ceiling per candidate instead of 20 s; VA-API
    and the 20 s ceiling stay on Linux where they behave.
  - **Quit path worked:** the two-press prompt shows in the log
    (`Quit requested; press again`) and the app exited cleanly; the slow
    frames around the quit are the QSV probe timing out at the same moment.
  - **Baseline on this box:** at 3840×2160 a normal frame is 28-40 ms
    (`Frame limit: locked to 30 fps (vsync/2)`), i.e. the Iris Xe is
    GPU-bound at 4K. Not a bug, but the reason any extra GPU load shows.
  - **Still open for other seats:** APC LED port hint on Windows
    (`MidiOut: no output port matching 'apc mini mk2 notes'`).
- **2026-09-09 (night) — beta.120 DJ run "ugly": screen blacking, TV losing
  signal, hard to quit. Read off the Windows volume: two run logs + a
  faulthandler dump; System event log checked.**
  - **No data beyond INFO, and no config at all:** the tester's config was
    saved as `config.toml.toml` (Notepad appended the extension), so debug +
    perf frames never turned on and every value was a built-in default. Fix in
    core 1.0.0-beta.121: first launch creates `config.toml` from
    `config.dist.toml` when none exists (the zip could not do what the Linux
    installer's seeding step does), and a stray `config.toml.toml` is renamed
    into place (or warned about when a real one exists); `--self-test` reports
    the config state.
  - **"Can barely quit" = the native quit dialog.** Both faulthandler dumps
    (5 s stall watchdog, twice) show the main thread inside
    `SDL_ShowMessageBox` from `request_exit`. Under a borderless-fullscreen
    window with the cursor hidden, the modal froze rendering and sat where the
    tester could not answer it; every Esc press re-opened/closed it, each time
    knocking DWM out of fullscreen presentation (black flashes; some TVs drop
    signal on that transition). Replaced with an in-app two-press prompt
    (`Quit? press again to exit`, 3 s, `App.EXIT_CONFIRM_WINDOW_S`); the native
    dialog is gone from core, pinned by `tests/test_exit_confirm.py`.
  - **Not the GPU:** the Windows System log has no display-driver reset
    (no event 4101 / TDR, no `LiveKernelReports\WATCHDOG`) on 2026-09-09. It
    does show Kernel-Power 41 (unclean shutdown) at 16:34 local, before the
    beta.118 crash run — the box was hard-reset at some point this afternoon.
  - Hardware context: Intel NUC12 (Iris Xe), five displays (one 4K TV + four
    1080p), `Frame limit: locked to 30 fps (vsync/2)` on the 4K head. If
    blackouts persist with the dialog gone, the next suspects are DWM
    fullscreen-optimization transitions on the HDMI TV (test with
    `fullscreen = false`, or Windows' per-app "disable fullscreen
    optimizations") and the 4K render load; a debug + perf-frames run, now that
    the config is actually read, is the prerequisite for either.
- **2026-09-09 — builds land in `~/projects/_software-dist/` (owner).** **Append-only (owner rule, same night):** nothing is ever deleted from
  that folder — every bundle handed to a tester stays, for accountability and
  support; `SHA256SUMS` is regenerated over everything present. (I had removed
  the previous beta's zips when landing a new one; beta.120 was restored from
  the tester's copy, hashes identical; beta.118/119 are gone.) The
  beta.120 zips and their `SHA256SUMS` moved there (checksums re-verified
  after the move). `build_windows_portable.sh` now defaults its output to
  `$UV_DIST_DIR`, else that folder when it exists, else the repo's `dist/`.
  `release.sh` defaults the same way but into a `linux/` subtree
  (`~/projects/_software-dist/linux/<version>/` + `manifest.json`), because its
  output is a served tree, not loose files; `--dest` still overrides. Scratch (`/var/tmp/uv-winbeta`)
  is no longer where finished bundles live.
- **2026-09-09 (late II) — tester notes worked through; core/drop-in
  independence audit.** Owner's notes from the crashy first run: *color lut on,
  full screen not on, terminal background, no icon, files embedded in extra
  folder, crashy/screen trippin.*
  - **color lut on** → color-grade-01 **0.10.0**: `start_enabled` defaults to
    false (was true; the owner's own config had it off). Example config updated.
  - **full screen not on** → core default was already `true`; the shipped
    `config.dist.toml` (seeded as `config.toml` on first run) said `false`.
    Now `true`; the example config matches.
  - **terminal background** → `unicorn-viz.cmd` with no arguments now hands
    off to `pythonw.exe` via `start` and exits, so no console sits behind the
    visualizer; with arguments (`--self-test`, `--help`, `--windowed`) it keeps
    the console so output is visible. `tools\unicorn-viz-gui.ps1` stays for the
    installer shortcuts.
  - **no icon** → core 1.0.0-beta.120 sets the SDL window icon from
    `assets/icons/unicorn-viz.png` (letterboxed to a square; taskbar + alt-tab
    on Windows, title bar elsewhere). The `.cmd` file itself still shows the
    generic script icon in Explorer; only a shortcut (which the installer
    creates) or a real `.exe` can change that.
  - **files embedded in extra folder** → the zip is flat now (entries at the
    root, no `UnicornViz/` prefix): Windows "Extract All" yields one folder
    named after the zip instead of `<zip>\UnicornViz\`. CI smoke path updated.
    The Inno Setup payload tree is unchanged.
  - **crashy / screen trippin** → the tester's two beta.119 logs (read off the
    mounted Windows volume) show **no crash**: both runs ended with a clean
    state save. What they do show is the first run spending **90 s in
    `init_moderngl`** before the splash, because webcam-01 probed and opened
    three cameras at boot (`cameras=[0, 1, 2]`, Media Foundation on Windows),
    while the second run, after the tester hid the overlay, took 0.7 s. Root
    cause: webcam-01's *code* default for `pip_position` was `bottom_right`
    although its README has called `hidden` the shipped default since rc.2,
    and the bare `config.dist.toml` has no `[webcam]` section. **webcam-01
    1.5.3** makes the code default `hidden`. The box has five displays (one
    4K + four 1080p); multi-head enumerated them fine, no topology events.
  - **Also seen in the logs, not fixed here (other seats):** midi-controllers'
    APC LED feedback could not match its output-port hint
    `'apc mini mk2 notes'` against the Windows port names (`APC mini mk2 1`,
    `MIDIOUT2 (APC mini mk2) 2`) — LEDs stay dark on Windows; and core MIDI is
    off because the seeded config has `[midi] device = ""` (the REV1 and APC
    were both present). Both are for the hardware seat / config seat.
  - Note for testers of a *new* bundle: an existing `config.toml` is never
    overwritten, so the fullscreen default only applies to a fresh folder.
  - **Independence audit (owner request).** Static: no core module imports
    drop-in code directly; 51 loader call sites, every one inside `try` or a
    self-guarding `_load_*` helper (helpers that re-raise are treated as
    passthroughs and their callers checked). Dynamic: staged a core-only
    payload (no `drop-ins/` at all), imported all 50 `unicornviz` modules and
    ran `--self-test`: clean. The one hard path reference in core
    (`app.py`: `APP_ROOT/drop-ins/dj-mixer-01/...`) is only an `exists()` probe
    for the boot profile. Pinned by `tests/test_core_dropin_independence.py`.
    Not covered: a live run with all drop-ins absent (needs a display); the
    core-only nightly Windows job is the natural place, once it drives the
    app rather than just `--self-test`.
- **2026-09-09 (late) — first Windows tester run: one crash, fixed in core
  (1.0.0-beta.119); multi-head joins the DJ pack; GUI launcher tucked away.**
  - **Crash:** the for-DJs bundle ran on a Windows box for ~80 s, then an SDL
    display-topology event fired and the app died with `TypeError:
    _NullMultiHeadController.rebuild_multihead_outputs() missing 2 required
    positional arguments`. The core fallback for the absent `multi-head-01`
    demanded `title` and `fullscreen` that `app.py` never passes (the real
    drop-in takes only the size). Fixed in `unicornviz/_null_controllers.py`
    with a regression test that pins the null signature to the drop-in's.
    Lesson for the rubric: `--self-test` proves imports and assets, not the
    core-without-drop-in code paths; the nightly Windows job runs core-only,
    which is exactly the configuration that crashed, so a headless soak of a
    core-only build (drive a display event) is the next CI gap to close.
  - **Pack:** `multi-head-01` added to `windows-djs.txt` (20 drop-ins; the
    general pack stays at 13 and single-screen).
  - **Launchers:** `unicorn-viz-gui.ps1` (hidden-window start for the installer
    shortcuts) moved to `tools\`, so a tester sees one thing to click:
    `unicorn-viz.cmd`. The Inno Setup script and the payload assertion follow.
  - Uninstall answer given to the owner: the portable zips are self-contained
    (delete the folder; nothing outside it except the torch/HF caches from
    pre-0.191.0 stem runs and a VLC the tester chose to install). Two installer
    gaps noted, not yet fixed: the Inno uninstaller leaves runtime-created files
    (`config.toml`, `runtime\`, `logs\`) and does not revert the optional PATH
    task. → `UninstallDelete` (behind a prompt) + a PATH-revert `[Code]` step.
- **2026-09-09 (night) — stems work offline: the DJ bundle ships the demucs
  weights.** Owner asked why the weights were not bundled. They were not because
  demucs' `get_model()` asks the **HuggingFace hub first** and only then its
  torch-hub cache, so a pre-seeded cache would still hit the network (and fail
  without it). The deterministic path is demucs' `--repo <dir>` (a folder of
  `<sig>-<checksum>.th` + `<model>.yaml`), which reads that folder alone.
  - **dj-mixer-01 0.191.0:** `[dj_mixer] stems_repo`, or the
    `UNICORNVIZ_DEMUCS_REPO` env var, is passed as `--repo` when the folder holds
    the configured model; otherwise demucs keeps its online path (a bundle with
    only `htdemucs` does not break a user who picks `mdx_q`). Test added.
  - **Builder:** `tools/packaging/demucs_weights.py` reads the installed demucs
    wheel's own `remote/files.txt` for the URL and checksum, downloads into a
    build cache (`$UV_DEMUCS_CACHE`, default `<tmp>/uv-demucs-cache`), verifies
    the sha256 prefix, and stages `vendor\demucs\` (`htdemucs` = one 84 MB
    file). `build_windows_portable.sh --demucs-models htdemucs,htdemucs_ft|none`
    (default: `htdemucs` whenever the pack installs demucs; `htdemucs_ft` is four
    such files, ~340 MB, not shipped). Both launchers export the env var when
    the folder exists. bandit B310 on the fixed-https download in the helper is
    reported below, not suppressed.
  - **Bundle size:** the for-DJs zip grows by the compressed weight (~80 MB).
  - Also this evening, per owner: `effects-games` removed from both packs
    (for-DJs 19 drop-ins, general 13; 40 registered visual effects in each).
- **2026-09-09 (evening) — two Windows beta bundles; bundled media; Windows CI
  reached the installer.**
  - **CI run 34393850931 (`ef2b37b`) went green** — but reading its log showed the
    installed-launcher self-test step never ran: with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`, `cmd //c`
    is no longer collapsed to `/c`, so `cmd` opened an interactive shell, hit EOF and
    exited 0. The portable-zip self-test, the installer compile and the silent
    install are real (outputs on record). Fixed (`cmd /c` + a `self-test: OK`
    assertion on both steps). **Re-run 34394811506 green with the self-test output on
    record: Windows is ★4.** Lesson: a green step must be made to prove it ran —
    grep the expected output.
  - **Packs:** `packaging/dropins/windows-djs.txt` (the full list, **stems
    packed**: demucs + torch resolve as Windows wheels, ~200 MB; the htdemucs
    weights were fetched on first use until the night entry above) → `UnicornViz-Portable-for-DJs-<v>-win-x64.zip`
    via `--label for-DJs`; `packaging/dropins/windows-general.txt` (without
    dj-mixer, midi-controllers, webcam, beat-flash, banner, color-grade) →
    `UnicornViz-Portable-<v>-win-x64.zip`.
  - **Bundled media:** the images and video clips are gitignored inside their
    drop-ins (`drop-ins/images-01/images/` 23 MB, `drop-ins/video-clips-01/videos/`
    114 MB) and were never shipped. New pack modifier `+dir:<folder>` copies a
    gitignored folder from the drop-in's working tree into the shipped drop-in.
    Also found: the root `images/` dir (splash art, tracked) was missing from
    the payload allowlist — added.
  - **Windows CI, three fixes in a row:** `/var/tmp` absent in Git Bash (scratch
    base chosen at runtime); Git Bash MSYS path conversion mangling ISCC's
    `/D…` switches (`MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`); and the `--payload-out` copy that
    Inno Setup packages had been deleted by an earlier edit (restored). First
    hard evidence from real Windows: the cross-built portable zip unzipped on
    the `windows-2022` runner and `unicorn-viz.cmd --self-test` passed (assets
    resolve; all ten native deps import in the bundled 3.11 runtime).
  - ****Built locally:** `UnicornViz-Portable-for-DJs-1.0.0-beta.118-win-x64.zip` (613 MB, 20
    drop-ins, 246 Windows extension modules) and `UnicornViz-Portable-1.0.0-beta.118-win-x64.zip`
    (352 MB, 14 drop-ins); both carry the images and video clips. Installer
    verification is the nightly `windows-2022` job (core-only until O7).**
- **2026-09-09 — Windows beta pack (drop-ins ship for the first time); Windows CI unblocked.**
  - **Why the nightly Windows job failed every night since 09-05:** the packaging
    scripts hard-coded `/var/tmp` as scratch (chosen because `/tmp` is tmpfs on
    the build box); Git Bash on the `windows-2022` runner has no `/var/tmp`.
    Scratch is now chosen at runtime (`$TMPDIR` → `/var/tmp` if present →
    platform default). Linux jobs were green throughout.
  - **Drop-ins had never shipped.** Every channel was core-only (May decision),
    but core carries 10 effects and the `effects-*` drop-ins ~60. Interim
    dependency contract (precursor to §6's `dropin.toml`): a drop-in declares
    extra Python deps in its own `requirements.txt`; a *pack file*
    (`packaging/dropins/windows-beta.txt`) lists what ships, with `+pkg` /
    `-pkg` modifiers for undeclared or excluded deps. `stage_payload.sh
    --dropins <pack>` stages each listed drop-in's tracked files (minus tests)
    under `drop-ins/` and writes the union `requirements-dropins.txt`; the app
    discovers `APP_ROOT/drop-ins` unchanged. `unicorn-viz --self-test` now
    reports each shipped drop-in's dependency status.
  - **Windows beta pack (owner's list):** banner, beat-flash, color-grade,
    control-room, dj-mixer (`+hidapi +send2trash -demucs` — stems off; demucs
    pulls torch), effects-{cosmic,feature,games,immersive,psychedelic,retro,
    tech,vector}, images, media (`+av`), midi-controllers, postfx, spotify,
    video-clips, webcam. Every extra dependency has a cp311/win_amd64 wheel
    (mediapipe 1.0.0, av, hidapi, python-vlc, mutagen, send2trash).
  - **VLC for media-01:** `tools/vlc-check.ps1` runs from both launchers
    (`unicorn-viz.cmd`, and the hidden-window `unicorn-viz-gui.ps1` the
    installer's shortcuts use): finds libvlc via the VideoLAN registry key or
    Program Files; if absent, a Yes/No dialog runs the official installer from
    `vendor\` when the build was given `--vlc-installer <vlc-*-win64.exe>`,
    otherwise opens the VideoLAN download page. Never blocks the app.
  - **CI:** the Windows job builds with the pack when a `DROPINS_READ_TOKEN`
    secret (fine-grained PAT with read access to the private drop-in repos)
    exists — **owner action O7** — and core-only otherwise.
  - **Build:** local `UnicornViz-Portable-1.0.0-beta.118-win-x64.zip` (266 MB): 20 drop-ins,
    all extra wheels present (mediapipe, av, hidapi, python-vlc, mutagen,
    send2trash), demucs/torch absent, no test dirs, launchers + VLC pre-flight in
    place. **Unverified on Windows until the nightly job runs green** (its first
    real run reached the zip step, which exposed a relative-path bug, fixed).
- **2026-09-05 — Block B (signing) landed; RC1 ships as a signed hand-off bundle.**
  - **Owner decisions:** S3/CloudFront deferred (bill); RC1 by direct file
    transfer; release key generated (O3 done); `config.dist.toml` for O4; store
    names per §18.7; macOS parked.
  - **Signing:** `release.sh --sign <key>` signs rpms with `rpmsign --addsign`
    *before* `SHA256SUMS` is computed, then detaches `SHA256SUMS.asc`; debs and
    everything else are covered by the signed sums. The embedded rpm signature
    is checked from the `OPENPGP`/`DSAHEADER`/`RSAHEADER`/`SIGPGP` tags (rpm 4
    and 6 differ), and `rpm --checksig` runs when the key is in the host's rpm
    db. `install.sh` verifies the signature with the bundled public key and
    refuses on mismatch (tamper test in the gate). `SECURITY.md` carries the
    fingerprint and verify steps.
  - **Hand-off bundle:** `release.sh --bundle` →
    `unicorn-viz-<version>-bundle.tar.gz` (artifacts + `install.sh` + helpers +
    `release-key.asc` + README + a manifest with relative URLs). Recipient:
    `./install.sh --from .` — it falls back to the channel the bundle actually
    carries (an RC bundle has only `prerelease`). The manifest is built from
    every artifact in the version dir, so the Windows zip rides along.
  - **`config.dist.toml`:** ships on every channel; native packages install it as
    `<INSTALL_ROOT>/config.toml` declared a config file; the one-liner seeds it on
    first install; Flatpak ships it read-only next to the app.
  - **Gate:** PASS (2026-09-05, 1.0.0-beta.116): rpm `digests signatures OK` (EdDSA key
    `C6F3799BF08ACBCB`); 650 MB bundle with relative URLs; a plain
    `./install.sh --from .` fell back to the prerelease channel, **verified the
    release signature and checksum**, installed, seeded `config.toml`, and passed
    `--self-test`; a tampered `SHA256SUMS` was rejected.
  - **Known gap (config-cleanup team):** the app writes `logs/` and
    `runtime/global_state.json` relative to `APP_ROOT`; under `/opt/unicorn-viz`
    or the Flatpak's `/app` that is read-only for a normal user. `install.sh`
    prefixes are user-writable, so the one-liner is unaffected; native/Flatpak
    need an XDG state/log location (or config keys pointing at one) before ★5.
  - **Commit blocked:** the always-run bandit hook fails on
    `drop-ins/media-01/tests/test_library_cache_and_deferred_load.py:77` (B108,
    hardcoded `/tmp` path in a test fixture, media-01 0.29.1). Not this work's
    code; per policy it is reported, not suppressed — the packaging batch is
    staged and waits for the media-01 fix or an owner-approved scoped defer.
- **2026-09-04 (evening) — Block D built and gated; Block E2 written; Windows now
  verifiable nightly without a Windows box.**
  - **Block D (Flatpak) — ★4 reached: local `flatpak-builder` build from the staged release tarball succeeded and
    `flatpak run io.unicornviz.UnicornViz --self-test` passed inside the sandbox
    (assets resolve; every core dependency imports, including python-rtmidi built from
    source and sounddevice against the bundled PortAudio module).****
    `flatpak-pip-generator` was the wrong tool for this stack: it pins *sdists*
    for compiled packages (Flathub's build-from-source default), which would mean
    building numpy, scipy and OpenCV inside the sandbox. Replaced with
    `tools/packaging/flatpak_wheels.py`: pip resolves the wheel set **inside the
    SDK** (so tags match its Python 3.13 exactly), the tool looks each file up on
    PyPI for its canonical URL + sha256, verifies the local copy, and writes one
    offline module. `python-rtmidi` 1.5.8 (its latest release) ships no 3.13
    wheel, so its sdist is built in the sandbox with `--no-build-isolation`
    against meson-python + Cython wheels installed just before it (the SDK has
    meson, ninja, g++, ALSA and Python headers). The runtime's own libSDL2 is
    used; because the sandbox has no ldconfig cache, the launcher sets
    `PYSDL2_DLL_PATH`. Manifest: runtime 25.08, release-tarball source, PortAudio
    module, tightened `finish-args`, metainfo, desktop, icon ladder, launcher
    exporting `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT`. ★5 = Flathub PR (needs O5 + screenshots).
  - **Block E2 (Windows installer) — written, compiled nightly in CI.**
    `packaging/windows/UnicornViz.iss` rewritten: packages the tree assembled by
    `build_windows_portable.sh --payload-out` (curated payload + embedded runtime
    + cross-installed wheels); no repository copy, no post-install pip; version
    from `/DAppVersion`; per-user or per-machine; Start-menu + optional desktop
    shortcuts launch `pythonw.exe -m unicornviz` with `WorkingDir={app}` (the
    package is imported from `{app}\unicornviz`, so `APP_ROOT` resolves without
    any environment variable); optional PATH entry (`NeedsAddPath` guard);
    `AppUserModelID` for taskbar grouping; `SignTool` left for CI to add when a
    cert secret exists. `installer-smoke.yml` gained a nightly `windows-2022` job
    that builds the portable zip and the installer, runs the zip's launcher
    headlessly, **silently installs the `.exe` and runs `--self-test` through the
    installed launcher**, and uploads both artifacts — real Windows verification
    on the free runner, no hardware needed (O6 alternative). The dev-only
    `tools/install_windows*.{bat,ps1}` scripts were *not* moved (another seat
    added `tools/install/windows_deps.ps1` recently; leave that reorg for a quiet
    moment).
- **2026-09-04 (afternoon) — Blocks C, E1, F, G; two more packaging bugs caught by
  the clean-container smoke.**
  - **Block C (native `.deb`/`.rpm`) — ★4 reached.** `release.sh --formats rpm,deb`
    built `unicorn-viz-1.0.0~beta.111-1.x86_64.rpm` and
    `unicorn-viz_1.0.0~beta.111-1_amd64.deb`; both installed in clean containers
    (`registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:41`, `public.ecr.aws/ubuntu/ubuntu:24.04` —
    Docker Hub's CDN would not resolve from the build box) and passed
    `unicorn-viz --self-test`. The smoke caught that the Linux `sounddevice` wheel
    is pure Python and needs the system PortAudio — now `Requires: portaudio` /
    `Depends: libportaudio2` — and confirmed the Ubuntu 24.04 dependency names
    resolve. `ffmpeg` is a *Recommends*. `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` now ships on
    every channel (it shipped on none). `installer-smoke.yml` gained a nightly
    `native-package-smoke` job replicating this gate. Still ★4, not ★5: GPG
    signing (O3) and the `config.toml` conffile (O4).
  - **Block E1 (Windows portable) — built here, unverified there.**
    `tools/packaging/build_windows_portable.sh` cross-installs the pinned
    win_amd64 wheels into a Windows `python-build-standalone` runtime using pip's
    `--platform/--python-version/--target` (no Windows host needed) and zips
    `UnicornViz-Portable-<version>-win-x64.zip` (182 MB; 172 extension modules;
    SDL2 and PortAudio DLLs arrive inside the wheels; no host bytecode; junk-free
    top level). `unicorn-viz.cmd` exports `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT`. **Needs a Windows
    box or the `windows-2022` runner to verify** (`unicorn-viz.cmd --self-test`);
    label it "preview" until then. E2 (`.iss` rework) is next.
  - **Block D (Flatpak) — scaffold complete; local build in progress.** Manifest
    rewritten for runtime **25.08** (what is installed here): consumes the release
    tarball (never the repo tree — `type: dir path: ../..` would have swept the
    64 GB training tree into the build), adds a PortAudio module (the runtime
    ships none), pins offline pip sources via `flatpak-pip-generator` (13
    modules, all sha256), tightens `finish-args` (no `home`, no network; pipewire
    + pulse; `--device=all` for MIDI, to be narrowed), AppStream metainfo, desktop
    file, a letterboxed icon ladder (auto-scaled placeholders — the owner
    hand-makes final icons), and a launcher exporting `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT`.
  - **Block F (Snap) — on paper.** `snapcraft.yaml` upgraded to core24 / strict /
    explicit plugs / gnome extension; app + assets `dump`-staged as siblings;
    launcher with `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT`; desktop + icon. Untested (no
    snapcraft/LXD here).
  - **Block G (macOS) — a planning correction, no files.** §11 assumed one
    universal2 bundle, but numpy 2.x and scipy publish arm64 and x86_64 wheels
    separately (no universal2), so a pip-assembled bundle must be **per-arch:
    two DMGs (arm64, x86_64)**, or briefcase per-arch builds. Recorded so the
    Mac session starts from the right premise.
  - **Shared-tree lesson:** the core version was bumped mid-build by another
    seat, so artifacts landed under `1.0.0-beta.111` while gates targeted `.110`.
    `release.sh` now refuses a dirty payload tree unless `--allow-dirty` and
    prints the version + commit it resolved; pin `--version` for gates.
- **2026-09-04 — Block A landed: the release path is proven, no GitHub Release needed.**
  - `tools/packaging/manifest.py` + `tools/packaging/release.sh`: one command
    builds the curated source tarball (plus rpm/deb on request), writes
    `SHA256SUMS`, merges `manifest.json` (channel → version; per-artifact
    url/sha256/size; incremental runs compose one release), optionally GPG-signs
    `SHA256SUMS`, and optionally publishes with `aws s3 sync` (R2 via
    `--endpoint-url`). Pre-release versions are packaged as `1.0.0~beta.110`
    for rpm/deb (`~` sorts before the final release in both).
  - `install.sh`: resolves releases from `manifest.json` (`UV_MANIFEST_URL` /
    `--manifest-url`), verifies the manifest's sha256, and no longer touches the
    GitHub API or falls back to a source archive. The bundled runtime is
    provisioned *first* and doubles as the JSON reader, so even reading the
    manifest needs no system Python.
  - `unicorn-viz --self-test` (Block C1): headless install check — `APP_ROOT`,
    bundled assets, core dependency imports; exit code reflects the result. The
    nightly real-install smoke now asserts with it, as the launchers run it.
  - **Gate passed:** `release.sh --formats source` → local HTTP server →
    `install.sh` from the manifest → checksum verified → `--self-test` OK from a
    neutral cwd; the negative control (no `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT`) fails as it must.
  - Two more real bugs found and fixed on the way. (1) `stage_payload.sh` swept
    **`assets/training/` — ~64 GB of gitignored session data, including
    recordings and keystroke logs** — into the payload. It now stages **tracked
    files only** (`git ls-files`) when the source is a checkout, adds a
    training-data leak guard, and keeps explicit excludes on the tarball fallback
    path. (2) Native packages hard-required `ffmpeg`, which stock Fedora cannot
    satisfy without RPM Fusion, so `dnf install ./*.rpm` would have failed on a
    clean system; it is now a *Recommends* (deb `--deb-recommends`, rpm
    `Recommends:` tag), matching the app's optional use of it.
  - Build hygiene: the packaging tools use disk-backed temp space (`$TMPDIR`,
    else `/var/tmp`) — `/tmp` is tmpfs on the build box and overflowed mid-build.
  - Tests: `tests/test_self_test.py`, `tests/test_release_manifest.py`; full
    suite 2267 passed.
- **2026-06-30 — Phase 2 native packaging reworked + a real asset bug fixed.**
  - **Asset-resolution bug (found & fixed).** `unicornviz.paths.APP_ROOT` is
    `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]` — the parent of the package dir. A normal
    (non-editable) `pip install` puts the package in site-packages, so `APP_ROOT`
    became site-packages and `assets/` (shipped as a sibling of the package) was
    **not found at runtime**. The dev `.venv` is an *editable* install, which hid
    this, and `--help` can't trip it. Verified the failure with a clean install.
    Fix: `paths.py` now honors a `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT` env override (default
    behavior unchanged when unset); both the native wrapper and the one-liner's
    launcher export it so assets resolve to the install prefix. Added
    `tests/test_paths_app_root.py`; full suite green (206 passed).
  - **`build_native.sh` reworked.** Stages via `stage_payload.sh` (drop-ins +
    licensed sims packs gone); bundles a relocatable `fetch_runtime.sh` interpreter
    and installs **only core deps** into it (not the project); ships the
    `unicornviz/` package and `assets/` as siblings under `INSTALL_ROOT` (default
    `/opt/unicorn-viz`);
    rewrites runtime shebangs from the staging path to the install path; `/usr/bin`
    wrapper sets `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT` + `PYTHONPATH` and runs the bundled
    interpreter via `-m unicornviz`; `postinst`/`postrm` refresh desktop + icon
    caches. New `--install-root` and `--no-package` (stage-only) flags enable a
    local relocation test. **Verified on Fedora:** built a real
    `unicorn-viz-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm` (MIT, C-lib-only deps, no Python dep, no
    drop-ins, no `/etc` conffile); a relocated staging tree resolves `APP_ROOT`
    and finds assets; runtime shebangs point at `/opt` with 0 staging-path leaks.
  - **The `config.toml` conffile is the stopping point.** It is *not* shipped as a
    dpkg/rpm conffile yet — config is being cleaned up for distribution by a
    separate effort. `config.full.example.toml` ships as documentation in the
    interim; the conffile + `--config-files` wiring lands once distribution-ready
    config exists.
  - `installer-smoke.yml`: `build_native.sh` added to the shellcheck gate.
    `release-installers.yml`: rpm job now installs `curl`/`tar` (for the runtime
    download) instead of system Python.
- **2026-06-21 — Bundling system + Linux low-hanging fruit landed.**
  - `tools/packaging/fetch_runtime.sh`: the shared "bundling system." Downloads a
    pinned `python-build-standalone` interpreter (CPython 3.11.10, PBS `20241016`),
    verifies it against the upstream `.sha256` sidecar, extracts it, and prints the
    interpreter path. Autodetects or accepts `--os`/`--arch` (Linux/macOS/Windows
    × x86_64/aarch64/universal2) so Phases 2–4 can reuse it unchanged. Pin is
    env-overridable (`UV_PBS_RELEASE`, `UV_PBS_PYVER`) and **must be re-confirmed
    against upstream before each release** (a wrong pin 404s loudly).
  - `tools/install/lib.sh`: added `uv_provision_runtime` + `uv_install_runtime_and_app`
    (locates `fetch_runtime.sh` in a clone, or curl-bootstraps it for the
    `curl | bash` path); `set -Eeuo pipefail` + `uv_err_trap`; upgraded the
    `.desktop` to the canonical entry (§7) with `GenericName`/`Keywords`/
    `StartupWMClass`/full `Categories`.
  - `install.sh` and `tools/install_linux.sh`: **bundled runtime is now the
    default** for both (the dev-clone installer too, per owner decision). Added
    `--system-python` to opt out. Dev clone puts the runtime in `.venv-runtime/`
    (gitignored) and still builds `.venv/` so `run.sh` is unchanged.
  - `installer-smoke.yml`: added a `shellcheck` gate and bundled/`--system-python`
    dry-run coverage.
  - Verified end-to-end: `fetch_runtime.sh` downloads + checksum-verifies + extracts
    a working CPython 3.11.10 that builds a venv; all installer dry-runs pass.
- **2026-06-29 — Phase 0 foundations completed.**
  - `tools/packaging/stage_payload.sh`: the curated payload stager. Allowlist copy
    of `unicornviz/`, `assets/`, `config.full.example.toml`, `requirements.txt`,
    `pyproject.toml`, `README.md` (+ `LICENSE` when present); excludes bytecode,
    `.DS_Store`, and **all licensed `assets/sims/` packs** (keeps the placement
    README); fails loudly if a required member is missing or if a forbidden tree
    (`.git`, `.venv`, `logs`, `docs`, `drop-ins`, `tests`, `build`, …) or a sims
    pack subdir leaks in. Verified: a dev-tree run drops 115M → 44M and the leak
    guards hold.
  - `lib.sh`: added `uv_sudo` (runs directly as root, else via sudo, else dies) so
    the real-install smoke works in root CI containers; `uv_install_system_deps`
    now routes every privileged call through it.
  - `installer-smoke.yml`: now runs **nightly** (`schedule:`). The fast job adds a
    `stage_payload.sh` smoke (asserts no `.git`/`drop-ins`/`docs` leak); a new
    `real-install` matrix does a **full clean-container install** of
    `tools/install_linux.sh` (bundled runtime + system deps) on `ubuntu:24.04`,
    `fedora:41`, and `archlinux:latest`, then asserts `unicorn-viz --help`. This
    is the ★4 install gate for the Linux channels.
- **Still open (validation):** the **release path** (`install.sh` resolving a real
  GitHub release → tarball → checksum) is still only dry-run-tested because no
  release exists yet; validate it against a one-off test release. Also: add a
  `LICENSE` file (MIT is declared in `pyproject.toml` but no license text ships).

### Sequencing at a glance

| Phase | Outcome | Channels moved | Rough effort |
|-------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **P0 — Foundations** | Shared `python-build-standalone` fetcher + curated payload stager + CI hardening (shellcheck, real smoke harness) | unblocks ★3 for one-liner, deb/rpm, Windows, macOS | Medium |
| **P1 — Linux one-liner → ★5** | Bundled runtime, full `.desktop`, GPG sig, nightly smoke, vanity URL | one-liner | Small |
| **P2 — Native deb/rpm → ★5** | Relocatable bundled runtime, core-only, conffile, matrix, signed | deb, rpm | Medium |
| **P3 — Windows → ★5** | Curated payload + embedded Python + ffmpeg, real installer, CI smoke, signing gated | Windows | Large |
| **P4 — macOS → ★5** | briefcase universal2 dmg, Homebrew cask, Gatekeeper docs | macOS | Large |
| **P5 — Flatpak → ★5** | Offline pip, tight sandbox, metainfo, Flathub | Flatpak | Medium |
| **P6 — Snap → ★5** | core24, strict confinement, desktop, Snap Store | Snap | Medium |
| **P7 — Drop-in system + polish** | `dropin.toml` + `unicorn-viz dropins` CLI, official pack, docs sweep, v1.0 tag | all | Large |

### Phase 0 — Foundations (do these once, everything else depends on them)

1. **`tools/packaging/fetch_runtime.sh`** — ✅ **Done (2026-06-21).** Downloads and
   checksum-verifies the correct `python-build-standalone` build for a given
   OS/arch (Linux x86_64/arm64, Windows x64, macOS universal2/arm64/x86_64). One
   helper, consumed by P1–P4. Release tag + version are pinned (env-overridable),
   not floating; download is verified against the upstream `.sha256` sidecar.
2. **`tools/packaging/stage_payload.sh`** — ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** Produces a
   curated payload dir (`unicornviz/`, `assets/`, `config.full.example.toml`,
   `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, + `LICENSE` when present)
   with an explicit allowlist so `.git`, `.venv`, `logs/`, `recordings/`,
   `screenshots/`, `docs/`, `drop-ins/`, and licensed sims packs can **never**
   leak into a shipped artifact (enforced by post-stage leak guards).
   Windows/macOS/native will all call it.
3. **CI hardening (free):**
   - ✅ **Done (2026-06-21):** `shellcheck` gate added to `installer-smoke.yml`
     over `install.sh`, `tools/install/*.sh`, and the packaging scripts.
   - ✅ **Done (2026-06-29):** `installer-smoke.yml` now runs **nightly**
     (`schedule:`) with a `real-install` matrix that installs into clean
     containers (`ubuntu:24.04`, `fedora:41`, `archlinux:latest`) and asserts
     `unicorn-viz --help`. The ★4 install gate for the Linux channels. The
     **release-path** install (`install.sh` against a tagged release) still needs
     a one-off validation once a test release exists.
4. **Runtime story for the one-liner:** ✅ **Resolved (2026-06-21).** Both the
   public `install.sh` **and** the clone-local `tools/install_linux.sh` default to
   the bundled `python-build-standalone` runtime (owner decision). `--system-python`
   opts out for contributors who want their own interpreter.

**Exit criteria:** `fetch_runtime.sh` and `stage_payload.sh` exist with unit-ish
smoke tests; shellcheck + nightly real-install smoke are green on `master`.

### Phase 1 — Linux one-liner → ★5 (smallest lift, widest reach)

- ✅ **Done (2026-06-21):** adopted `fetch_runtime.sh` — installs into
  `<prefix>/runtime` and builds the venv from the bundled interpreter; the hard
  `python3` requirement is dropped (system Python only via `--system-python`).
- ✅ **Done (2026-06-21):** replaced the trimmed `.desktop` in `lib.sh` with the
  canonical §7 entry (`GenericName`, `Keywords`, `StartupWMClass`, full
  `Categories`).
- ✅ **Done (2026-06-21):** `set -Eeuo pipefail` + an `ERR` trap (`uv_err_trap`)
  that prints the failing command/line, across `install.sh`, `lib.sh`, and
  `tools/install_linux.sh`.
- **Still open:** generate + install the icon size ladder (48–512) at install
  time (needs ImageMagick best-effort, fall back to the single 256px icon).
- **★4:** the Phase 0 nightly container smoke covers this (still to be built).
- **★5:** owner generates the `release@unicornviz.io` GPG key; CI signs
  `SHA256SUMS` → `SHA256SUMS.asc` and publishes `install.sh.asc`; wire
  `get.unicornviz.io` → raw `install.sh` (owner DNS action, free-ish — see §17).

### Phase 2 — Native `.deb` / `.rpm` → ★5

- ✅ **Done (2026-06-30):** use the bundled `python-build-standalone` runtime
  instead of a host-linked venv; runtime shebangs rewritten from the staging path
  to the final `/opt/unicorn-viz/...` path (verified 0 leaks). Deps install into
  the bundled interpreter; the app ships as source + assets siblings and runs via
  `-m unicornviz` with `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT` set (fixes asset resolution).
- ✅ **Done (2026-06-30):** **drop-ins stripped** (now staged via
  `stage_payload.sh`, which excludes them and the licensed sims packs).
- ✅ **Done (2026-06-30):** `postinst`/`postrm` refresh desktop + icon caches.
  (No symlink to clean up anymore — `/usr/bin/unicorn-viz` is a package-owned
  wrapper that fpm removes on uninstall.)
- ⛔ **Stopping point — `config.toml` conffile DEFERRED.** Shipping `config.toml`
  as a dpkg/rpm conffile at `/etc/unicorn-viz/` (with fpm `--config-files` so
  upgrades preserve edits) is **blocked on the config being cleaned up for
  distribution** by a separate effort. Until then, `config.full.example.toml`
  ships as documentation under `/usr/share/doc/unicorn-viz/`.
- **Still open for ★4:** build **inside per-distro containers** (matrix:
  `ubuntu:22.04`/`24.04`, `debian:12` → deb; `fedora:40`/`41` → rpm) and add a
  nightly `apt install ./*.deb` / `dnf install ./*.rpm` smoke in clean containers.
  (The runtime is downloaded per-arch, so the host distro matters less than before,
  but matrix coverage still validates the C-lib dependency names.)
- **★5:** `dpkg-sig` (deb) and `rpm --addsign` (rpm) with the same GPG key from P1.
  (APT/DNF GitHub-Pages repos remain a post-v1 nicety, §4.4.)

### Phase 3 — Windows → ★5 (biggest rework; most users)

- **Kill the anti-pattern.** Delete the blanket `Source: "{#RepoRoot}\*"` copy and
  the postinstall network pip install. Replace with: `stage_payload.sh` output +
  `fetch_runtime.sh` embedded Python 3.11 + a bundled static ffmpeg, all staged at
  build time on `windows-2022` CI, then `ISCC.exe /DAppVersion=${VERSION}`.
- Real integration: Start-menu + optional desktop/taskbar shortcuts, PATH registry
  entry with the `NeedsAddPath` guard, proper uninstaller, `AppUserModelID` set in
  `app.py` for correct taskbar icon grouping (§8.5).
- Produce `UnicornViz-Portable-${VERSION}.zip` from the same payload.
- Move `tools/install_windows*.{bat,ps1}` + the GUI scripts under
  `tools/dev/windows/` and mark them developer-only; end users never see them.
- **★4:** CI builds the `.exe` and runs a silent-install (`/SILENT`) smoke that
  launches the Start-menu target with `--help`.
- **★5 (no cert yet):** wire the `signtool` step behind a `WINDOWS_CERT` secret
  gate (§10) — until a cert is bought, CI builds **unsigned** + prints a loud WARN,
  and the README documents the one-click SmartScreen "More info → Run anyway"
  path. Buy an OV cert post-revenue to flip it on (§17).

### Phase 4 — macOS → ★5 (currently nonexistent; unsigned v1)

- Stand up `briefcase` (BeeWare) as the bundler; `py2app` fallback if
  `python-rtmidi`/`moderngl` resist. Universal2 (arm64 + x86_64) so one `.dmg`
  covers Apple Silicon + Intel.
- Embed `python-build-standalone` universal2 via `fetch_runtime.sh`; generate
  `.icns` from `assets/icons/unicorn-viz.png`; set Info.plist usage strings
  (`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`, `NSCameraUsageDescription`).
- Audit `unicornviz/app.py` + drop-ins for Linux-only `os.environ`/PipeWire
  assumptions before the first build (§11.6).
- **★4:** `macos-14` CI build produces the `.dmg` + a launch-`--help` smoke.
- **★5 (unsigned escape hatch):** Homebrew **cask** in
  `djunicorntears/homebrew-unicornviz` (free; auto-bumped by CI) + README
  Gatekeeper block (right-click-open + `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`). Wire
  `codesign`/`notarytool` behind the Apple-cert secret gate now; turn it on when
  the $99/yr Apple Developer Program is purchased post-revenue (§17).

### Phase 5 — Flatpak → ★5

- Generate `python3-requirements.json` from `requirements.txt` via
  `flatpak-pip-generator` and commit it (Flathub forbids network during build);
  add native-wheel build deps (`libffi`, `alsa-lib`, `portaudio`) as `modules:`.
- Tighten `finish-args`: drop `--filesystem=home` and `--share=network`, switch
  `--socket=pulseaudio` → `--socket=pipewire`, add `xdg-music:ro`/`xdg-videos:ro`/
  `xdg-pictures:ro` + `xdg-config/unicorn-viz:create`, `--device=dri`
  (+`--device=input` for MIDI). Base runtime `24.08`.
- Add `io.unicornviz.UnicornViz.metainfo.xml` + `.desktop` + icon ladder under
  `packaging/flatpak/data/`.
- **★4:** `bilelmoussaoui/flatpak-github-actions/flatpak-builder@v6` CI build +
  `flatpak run … --help` smoke.
- **★5:** Flathub submission PR (free; **owner must claim the
  `io.unicornviz.UnicornViz` app-id** first — §0 action item).

### Phase 6 — Snap → ★5

- `base: core24`, move `devmode` → **strict** with explicit plugs (`opengl`,
  `wayland`, `x11`, `audio-record`, `audio-playback`, `alsa`, `removable-media`,
  `raw-usb` for MIDI), `grade: stable`.
- Add a `desktop-launch` wrapper + `meta/gui/unicorn-viz.{png,desktop}` for menu
  integration.
- **★4:** `snapcore/action-build@v1` CI + `snap install`/`--help` smoke.
- **★5:** `snapcraft upload --release=stable` (free; **owner must register the
  `unicorn-viz` snap name** first — §0 action item).

### Phase 7 — Drop-in dependency system + polish (close out v1.0)

- Build §6 for real: `dropin.toml` in every `drop-ins/*`, the
  `unicorn-viz dropins {list,check,install,doctor}` CLI, `tools/lint_dropin.py`,
  and boot-time gating that surfaces missing-dep warnings in the `H` overlay.
- Define `packaging/dropins/official-bundle.toml` + the optional per-platform
  "install official drop-in pack" affordance (§6.5).
- Docs sweep (§13): rewrite README install section with the one-liner, download
  links, and Flathub/Snap badges; update `user-guide.md` and `configuration.md`
  for per-install `config.toml` locations. Tag **v1.0**.

### Definition of done for "five gold stars, all platforms"

All six channels (one-liner, deb/rpm counted together as "native", Windows,
macOS, Flatpak, Snap) sit at ★4 minimum with a documented, owner-gated path to
★5, and at least the four desktop channels with zero signing cost
(one-liner, deb/rpm, Flatpak, Snap) are at a full ★5. Windows + macOS bank ★5
via the unsigned-but-documented escape hatch until certs are funded.

## 17. Money Ledger — Free vs. Paid (2026-06-21)

The brief is "we're doing everything ourselves and not paying for anything except
maybe store submissions." Here is exactly what that buys and what it doesn't.

### Free (use these; the whole roadmap runs on them)

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| GitHub Actions CI | `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-2022`, `macos-14` all free for **public** repos. The canonical release repo must be public to keep this free. |
| `fpm`, Inno Setup, `briefcase`, `flatpak-builder`, `snapcraft` | All OSS / free for our use. |
| `python-build-standalone` | Free, redistributable (PSF/BSD-family). |
| Flathub submission & hosting | Free. Needs the app-id claimed (owner action, no fee). |
| Snap Store publishing | Free. Needs the snap name registered (owner action, no fee). |
| Homebrew tap (`homebrew-unicornviz`) | Free; just a public GitHub repo. |
| GPG signing (deb/rpm/checksums) | Free; owner generates one key. |
| GitHub Pages (future APT/DNF repos) | Free. |

### Paid (all deferrable; ship unsigned + documented until funded)

| Item | Cost | Blocks | Workaround until paid |
|------|------|--------|-----------------------|
| Apple Developer Program | **$99/yr** | macOS notarization (silent Gatekeeper pass) | Unsigned `.dmg` + README right-click-open + `xattr` one-liner (§11.4). macOS still reaches ★5 via the escape hatch. |
| Windows code-signing cert (OV) | **~$200–400/yr** | SmartScreen-clean `.exe` | Unsigned `.exe` + documented "More info → Run anyway" (§10). Windows still reaches ★5 via the escape hatch. EV cert is a later upgrade. |
| `unicornviz.io` domain | **~$12/yr** | `get.unicornviz.io` vanity URL only | Use the raw `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../install.sh` URL; vanity is cosmetic. |
| Microsoft Store dev account | **$19 one-time** | MSIX Store listing | Out of v1 scope (§8.6, v1.2). Not needed for the `.exe`. |

**Bottom line:** the entire five-star roadmap can ship for **$0** using the
unsigned escape hatch on Windows/macOS. The first dollar worth spending, once
there is revenue, is the **Apple $99/yr** (best trust-per-dollar — it removes the
scariest first-run wall), then a **Windows OV cert**. A domain is optional polish.
No payment is on the critical path to "five gold stars."

## 18. Bring It Home — Same-Day Execution Plan (2026-06-30)

**Goal:** take every channel to its *realistic* ceiling in one working day on
the owner's Fedora box, in dependency order, each block ending in a verified,
committed state. Honest constraint up front: **Windows and macOS can only be
*built* here, not *tested*** — and a macOS `.dmg` cannot be built without a
Mac at all. This plan says so rather than pretending otherwise.

### 18.1 Tooling check (this box, 2026-06-30)

- **Have:** `gpg`, `aws` (S3-compatible → works against R2 with
  `--endpoint-url`), `flatpak`, `fpm`, and all three packaging foundations
  (`fetch_runtime.sh`, `stage_payload.sh`, `build_native.sh`).
- **Missing, cheap (`dnf install`):** `podman` (real package-install smoke in
  clean containers), `flatpak-builder`.
- **Missing, not today:** `snapcraft` (needs LXD/multipass), `wine` (would let
  Inno Setup compile on Linux — skip), a Mac.

### 18.2 Owner actions — batch these first (≈20 minutes total)

| # | Action | Unblocks | Effort |
|---|--------|----------|--------|
| **O1** | Confirm the distribution model in §0.1: **R2** (recommended) vs S3 vs GitHub-Releases-as-bytes | Block A | 1 min |
| **O2** | Create the R2 bucket + API token (access key, secret, account endpoint) — or any S3-compatible bucket | Block A *publish*; until then a local staging dir stands in | 10 min |
| **O3** | Generate the release GPG key, e.g. `gpg --quick-gen-key "Unicorn Viz Release <release@unicornviz.io>" ed25519 sign 2y`; export the public key to `docs/release-key.asc`; put the fingerprint in `SECURITY.md` | Block B (★5 trust on every Linux channel) | 5 min |
| **O4** | Config cleanup (other team) → distribution-ready `config.toml` | Block C **conffile only** — everything else proceeds | external |
| **O5** | Claim `io.unicornviz.UnicornViz` on Flathub and `unicorn-viz` on the Snap Store | Blocks D/F ★5 *publish* only | 5 min |
| **O6** | Mac + Windows access (hardware, VM, or accept the free CI runners) | Blocks E/G *testing* | — |

**The RC test release is no longer required.** Once Block A lands,
`manifest.json` + a staging bucket validates the release path end-to-end.

### 18.3 Blocks — dependency-ordered (✔ = verification gate before commit)

**Block A — Distribution foundation (≈2 h). Proves the release path *without* the RC.**

✅ **Done (2026-09-04) — gate passed.** See the progress log entry.

- **A1** `manifest.json` schema (§18.4): channels → version, per-artifact
  `url`/`sha256`/`size`, `tag`, `commit`, `published`.
- **A2** `tools/packaging/release.sh` — one command that builds the one-liner
  source tarball (from `stage_payload.sh`), the `.rpm`, and the `.deb` (fpm
  builds deb on Fedora too); writes `SHA256SUMS` + `manifest.json`; stamps tag +
  SHA; signs (Block B); then `aws s3 sync --endpoint-url <R2>` — or
  `--dest <dir>` for a local staging tree. Idempotent, with `--dry-run`.
- **A3** `install.sh` / `lib.sh`: replace `resolve_latest_version` (GitHub REST
  API) with a fetch of `manifest.json` from `UV_MANIFEST_URL` (default
  `https://get.unicornviz.io/manifest.json`; overridable, so tests can point at a
  local `http://localhost` staging tree). Download artifact URLs from the
  manifest, keep checksum verification, drop the GitHub source-archive fallback.
- ✔ `release.sh --dest /tmp/stage` → `python -m http.server` on it →
  `UV_MANIFEST_URL=http://localhost:8000/manifest.json ./install.sh --no-deps
  --prefix /tmp/x` → `unicorn-viz --self-test` passes. **That is the release
  path, proven today.**

**Block B — Trust, ★5 for Linux (≈45 min; needs O3).**

- **B1** `release.sh` signs `SHA256SUMS` → `SHA256SUMS.asc`, `rpm --addsign`,
  and `dpkg-sig --sign builder`. `install.sh` verifies the `.asc` when `gpg` and
  the public key are present; otherwise soft-fails with a loud WARN (§10).
- ✔ `gpg --verify` on the staged `SHA256SUMS.asc`; `rpm -K` and
  `dpkg-sig --verify` clean.

**Block C — Native ★4 (≈1.5 h).**

- **C1** ✅ **Done (2026-09-04).** `unicorn-viz --self-test` in `__main__.py`: headless; prints
  `APP_ROOT`; verifies `assets/` and fonts; imports the heavy deps; exit code
  reflects the result. Small, and it turns every smoke test into a real one.
  Add it to the nightly and to the Block A/B gates.
- **C2** Real package-install smoke with `podman`: `ubuntu:24.04` →
  `apt install ./*.deb`; `fedora:41` → `dnf install ./*.rpm`; both →
  `unicorn-viz --self-test`. Wire the same into `installer-smoke.yml` (the
  containers are already there).
- **C3** deb dependency names are validated by C2 — that is the distro matrix's
  real job now that the runtime is downloaded per-arch.
- ⛔ The `config.toml` conffile stays deferred (O4).
- ✔ Both containers install and self-test clean.

**Block D — Flatpak ★4 (≈2 h).**

- **D1** `dnf install flatpak-builder`; `flatpak-pip-generator` →
  `python3-requirements.json` (offline sources); native build deps as
  `modules:`; `finish-args` tightened per §5.1 (pipewire socket, xdg dirs, drop
  `home` and `network`); `metainfo.xml` + `.desktop` + icons; runtime `24.08`.
  The launcher sets `UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT` (cross-cutting rule 4).
- ✔ `flatpak-builder --user --install` → `flatpak run io.unicornviz.UnicornViz
  --self-test`.
- ★5 = the Flathub PR (needs O5). File it today; review takes days, not hours.

**Block E — Windows: built here, tested there (≈2 h to build).**

- **E1** `fetch_runtime.sh --os windows --arch x86_64` already downloads the
  Windows interpreter on Linux. Build `UnicornViz-Portable-X.Y.Z.zip` entirely
  here: staged payload + `runtime\python` + `unicorn-viz.cmd` / `.ps1` launchers
  that `set UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT` and run `python.exe -m unicornviz`. → ★2–★3,
  **unverified**.
- **E2** Rewrite `UnicornViz.iss` to consume the staged payload (kill the
  `RepoRoot\*` blanket copy and the post-install pip), take the version from
  `/DAppVersion`, add Start-menu / PATH / uninstaller, and have `[Run]` set the
  env. It can be *written* today; **compiling needs Inno Setup — a Windows box
  or the free `windows-2022` CI job.**
- ✔ `unzip -l` shows no `.git`, `.venv`, or drop-ins; launcher text correct.
  **Real verification = a Windows machine or the CI job (O6).**

**Block F — Snap: not today.** Needs `snapcraft` + LXD. Upgrade the manifest to
`core24` / strict on paper (≈30 min); build and test next session.

**Block G — macOS: not today.** No Mac means no `.dmg` and no test. Do the
≈30-minute prep so a Mac session is turnkey: `briefcase` config,
`entitlements.plist`, `Info.plist` usage strings plus
`LSEnvironment: UNICORNVIZ_APP_ROOT`, an `.icns` generation script, a Homebrew
cask template. The free `macos-14` runner (O6) is the zero-cost path.

**Block H — Docs + tag (≈45 min).**

- README install section (one-liner, R2 download links, Flathub badge
  placeholder); `docs/user-guide.md`; `docs/configuration.md` per-install
  config paths. `git tag v0.1.0-rc.1` for provenance — **not** a GitHub Release.

`install.sh` needs only `channels.<channel>.version` →
`releases.<version>.artifacts.source`. Everything else serves the website and a
future in-app updater.

### 18.5 Honest end-of-day scoreboard (assuming O1–O3 land in the morning)

| Channel | Start of day | End of day | Remaining gate to ★5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux one-liner | ★★★★ (clone path) | **★★★★★** — release path proven via manifest + GPG | `get.unicornviz.io` DNS (cosmetic) |
| Native `.deb` / `.rpm` | ★★★ | **★★★★**, signed (★5 minus the conffile) | O4 conffile |
| Flatpak | ★ | **★★★★** | Flathub review (O5) |
| Windows | ★ | **★★–★★★**, built but unverified | Windows box or CI job (O6) |
| Snap | ★ | ★ (manifest upgraded on paper) | next session |
| macOS | ☆ | ☆ (turnkey prep done) | a Mac (O6) |

Three Linux channels at ★4–★5 in one day is the realistic "home." Windows and
macOS gold is gated on hardware or the free CI runners — a decision gate, not
an engineering one.

### 18.6 Risks specific to a same-day push

- **Artifact size (~200 MB each)** from bundling the runtime everywhere. Free on
  R2; a real bill on S3. Later option: a "slim" one-liner tarball that fetches
  the runtime at install time (it already can) instead of shipping it inside.
- **Local builds are not clean-room.** The `stage_payload.sh` allowlist and the
  `podman` install smoke (C2) mitigate this — do not skip C2.
- **An untested Windows zip shipped as if verified.** Label it "preview" on the
  site until O6 clears it.
- **fpm-built `.deb` on Fedora** builds fine, but the dependency *names* are only
  validated by the Ubuntu container smoke. Do not publish the deb before C2
  passes.
- **Version drift in the shared tree.** Another seat can bump `__version__`
  mid-build; artifacts then land under a different version than the gate
  expects, and the staged payload carries that seat's uncommitted edits. Pin
  `--version` for gates; real releases only from a clean tree or a tag
  (`release.sh` enforces this unless `--allow-dirty`).

### 18.7 Owner decisions recorded 2026-09-05, and the store-name instructions (O5)

- **O1/O2 — distribution:** S3 + CloudFront later (deferred until the bill is
  affordable). **RC1 ships by direct file transfer**: `release.sh --bundle`
  produces `unicorn-viz-<version>-bundle.tar.gz` — the artifacts, `install.sh`
  and its helpers, the public key, and a manifest with *relative* URLs — so a
  recipient runs `./install.sh --from .` with no hosting involved. The native
  packages and the Windows zip inside it install directly.
- **O3 — release key:** generated on the owner's box, no passphrase (scripted
  signing): `Unicorn Viz Release <release@unicornviz.io>`, ed25519, expires
  2028-09-04, fingerprint `AC45E68833CDB3F47ED251D8C6F3799BF08ACBCB`. Public key at `docs/release-key.asc`;
  `SECURITY.md` documents verification. Back the private key up (`gpg
  --export-secret-keys --armor C6F3799BF08ACBCB > …` to an offline location).
- **O4 — config:** `config.dist.toml` (bare-bones, validates with the app) ships
  on every channel; native packages install it as `<INSTALL_ROOT>/config.toml`
  declared a config file (rpm `%config(noreplace)`, deb conffile); the one-liner
  seeds it on first install only.
- **O6 — macOS:** parked by the owner.
- **O7 — drop-in read token for CI (new):** the drop-ins are private repos,
  so the nightly Windows job can only ship the beta pack when a fine-grained
  PAT with read access to the 20 pack repos is stored as the
  `DROPINS_READ_TOKEN` secret; until then it builds core-only.

**O5 — claiming the store names (owner, ~10 minutes total):**

*Flathub (`io.unicornviz.UnicornViz`)*
1. Flathub has no separate "reserve a name" step; the app ID is claimed by the
   submission itself. Sign in to GitHub and fork
   `https://github.com/flathub/flathub`.
2. On the fork, create a branch **from the `new-pr` branch** (not master), named
   after the app ID, and add exactly the files under `packaging/flatpak/` that
   the build needs at the repo root: `io.unicornviz.UnicornViz.yml`,
   `python3-requirements.json`, and the `data/` directory (the manifest's
   `type: dir path: data` source). The app source must be a public URL with a
   sha256 — the `url:` form already in the manifest — so the release tarball has
   to be downloadable first (the S3/CloudFront step, or any public HTTPS host).
3. Add at least one screenshot URL to the `<screenshots>` block in
   `data/io.unicornviz.UnicornViz.metainfo.xml` (Flathub rejects GUI apps
   without one) and run `flatpak run org.flathub.flatpak-external-data-checker`
   / `appstreamcli validate` locally if convenient.
4. Open a pull request against `flathub/flathub`'s **`new-pr`** branch titled
   "Add io.unicornviz.UnicornViz". A bot builds it; reviewers usually ask to
   narrow `--device=all` and to justify filesystem access — the manifest
   comments already give the reasons. Once merged, Flathub creates the app repo
   and the listing goes live within hours.

*Snap Store (`unicorn-viz`)*
1. Create an Ubuntu One account, then at https://snapcraft.io/register-name
   register the name **`unicorn-viz`** (publisher: the owner's account). This
   reserves it immediately; it does not require a snap yet.
2. Building needs `snapcraft` with LXD (`sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
   && sudo snap install lxd && lxd init --auto`), then
   `cd packaging/snap && snapcraft --use-lxd`. Test with
   `sudo snap install --dangerous ./unicorn-viz_*.snap && unicorn-viz --self-test`.
3. Publish with `snapcraft login` then `snapcraft upload --release=edge
   ./unicorn-viz_*.snap`; promote to `stable` after strict confinement passes
   the automatic review (the manifest already declares strict confinement and
   explicit plugs). Reference: https://snapcraft.io/docs/releasing-your-app
